raft-l5-consensus,"The Raft consensus algorithm achieves distributed consensus through leader election and log replication. It uses a strong leader approach where one node is elected as leader and handles all client requests. The leader replicates log entries to followers, and entries are committed once a majority acknowledges them. Raft ensures safety through term numbers and the election restriction that prevents nodes with stale logs from becoming leaders."
raft-l3-basics,"Raft is a consensus algorithm that helps distributed systems agree on values. It works by electing a leader who manages all the data changes. The leader sends these changes to follower nodes who copy them. This makes sure all nodes have the same data even if some nodes fail."
