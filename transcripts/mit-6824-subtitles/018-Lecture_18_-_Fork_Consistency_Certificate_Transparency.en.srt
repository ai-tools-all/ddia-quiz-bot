alright hello everyone let's get started

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:08,670
alright hello everyone let's get started
 

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,959
alright hello everyone let's get started
I want to talk about a system called

4
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:11,969
I want to talk about a system called
 

5
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,350
I want to talk about a system called
certificate transparency today and this

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,360
certificate transparency today and this
 

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,950
certificate transparency today and this
is a bit of a departure from most of the

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
is a bit of a departure from most of the
 

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,109
is a bit of a departure from most of the
topics we talked about so far we've

10
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
topics we talked about so far we've
 

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,090
topics we talked about so far we've
talked about distributed systems that

12
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,100
talked about distributed systems that
 

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,980
talked about distributed systems that
are really closed systems where all the

14
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:24,990
are really closed systems where all the
 

15
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,740
are really closed systems where all the
participants are trustworthy they're all

16
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:27,750
participants are trustworthy they're all
 

17
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,950
participants are trustworthy they're all
maybe be run being run by the same sort

18
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:30,960
maybe be run being run by the same sort
 

19
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,479
maybe be run being run by the same sort
of mutually trusting organization like

20
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:32,489
of mutually trusting organization like
 

21
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:34,430
of mutually trusting organization like
rafters that way you know you just

22
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:34,440
rafters that way you know you just
 

23
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,049
rafters that way you know you just
assume at the RAF's tiers do what

24
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:36,059
assume at the RAF's tiers do what
 

25
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,790
assume at the RAF's tiers do what
they're supposed to do but there's also

26
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:40,800
they're supposed to do but there's also
 

27
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,560
they're supposed to do but there's also
plenty of systems out there particularly

28
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:42,570
plenty of systems out there particularly
 

29
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,360
plenty of systems out there particularly
systems sort of built an internet scale

30
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:44,370
systems sort of built an internet scale
 

31
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,260
systems sort of built an internet scale
where the systems are open and anyone

32
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:48,270
where the systems are open and anyone
 

33
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,750
where the systems are open and anyone
can participate being active participant

34
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:50,760
can participate being active participant
 

35
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,139
can participate being active participant
I mean in some big systems out there and

36
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:54,149
I mean in some big systems out there and
 

37
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,119
I mean in some big systems out there and
if you build systems that are completely

38
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:56,129
if you build systems that are completely
 

39
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:01,279
if you build systems that are completely
open in that way there's often no single

00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:01,289
open in that way there's often no single

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,319

mutually suspicious of everyone else and

mutually suspicious of everyone else and
if that's the situation you have to be

00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
if that's the situation you have to be
 

53
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,969
if that's the situation you have to be
able to build useful systems out of

able to build useful systems out of

00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:23,690
able to build useful systems out of
mutually distrusting pieces and this

56
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:23,700
mutually distrusting pieces and this
 

57
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,030
mutually distrusting pieces and this
makes in any sort of internet wide open

of top level systems issues when you're

62
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
of top level systems issues when you're
 

63
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,969
of top level systems issues when you're
thinking about designing a distributed

thinking about designing a distributed
 

65
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,819
thinking about designing a distributed
system so the most basic question when

66
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:34,829
system so the most basic question when
 

67
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,609
system so the most basic question when
you're building an open system is when

68
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:37,619
you're building an open system is when
 

69
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,929
you're building an open system is when
I'm talking to another computer or

are you talking to the right website and
 

77
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,789
are you talking to the right website and
this problem is actually close to

78
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:48,799
this problem is actually close to
 

79
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,859
this problem is actually close to
unsolvable it turns out there's really

80
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:51,869
unsolvable it turns out there's really
 

81
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,440
unsolvable it turns out there's really
there's lots of solutions and none

82
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,450
there's lots of solutions and none
 

83
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,929
there's lots of solutions and none
really work that well but it is the

00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:56,939
really work that well but it is the
 

85
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,120
really work that well but it is the
problem that certificate transparency

86
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,130
problem that certificate transparency
 

87
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,160
problem that certificate transparency
today's topic is trying to help with the

88
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,170
today's topic is trying to help with the
 

89
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,350
today's topic is trying to help with the
material today ties sort of backwards in

00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:06,360
material today ties sort of backwards in
 

91
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,779
material today ties sort of backwards in
the course to consistency it turns out

92
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:08,789
the course to consistency it turns out
 

93
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,859
the course to consistency it turns out
that a lot of what certificate

94
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:09,869
that a lot of what certificate
 

95
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,199
that a lot of what certificate
transparency do doing is ensuring that

96
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:12,209
transparency do doing is ensuring that
 

97
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,790
transparency do doing is ensuring that
all parties see

98
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:13,800
all parties see
 

99
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,220
all parties see
the same information about certificates

100
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:16,230
the same information about certificates
 

101
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,980
the same information about certificates
that's a real consistency issue and this

102
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:18,990
that's a real consistency issue and this
 

103
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,110
that's a real consistency issue and this
material also ties forward to blockchain

104
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
material also ties forward to blockchain
 

105
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,930
material also ties forward to blockchain
systems like blockchain which is what we

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,010
relatively few non cryptocurrency uses
 

113
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,000
relatively few non cryptocurrency uses
of a blockchain like design alright so

114
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,010
of a blockchain like design alright so
 

115
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,680
of a blockchain like design alright so
by way of introduction I want to start

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:39,690
by way of introduction I want to start
 

117
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:45,050
by way of introduction I want to start
with the situation on the web with web

121
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,930
security at any rate as it existed
before 1995 before certificates so this

122
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:50,940
before 1995 before certificates so this
 

123
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,270
before 1995 before certificates so this
is for 1995 and in particular there was

a there was a kind of attack in those
 

127
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,140
a there was a kind of attack in those
days that people were worried about

128
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,150
days that people were worried about

164
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:51,780
would talk to DNS servers say what's
 

165
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,170
would talk to DNS servers say what's
gmail.com it would reply with a IP

166
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:54,180
gmail.com it would reply with a IP
 

167
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,180
gmail.com it would reply with a IP
address I connected that IP address and

168
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,190
address I connected that IP address and
 

169
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,369
address I connected that IP address and
you know I need to authenticate myself

170
00:03:58,369 --> 00:03:58,379
you know I need to authenticate myself
 

171
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,050
you know I need to authenticate myself
so I'd probably type my password to

172
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,060
so I'd probably type my password to
 

173
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,509
so I'd probably type my password to
Gmail to Gmail's website and then Gmail

00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:02,519
Gmail to Gmail's website and then Gmail
 

175
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,180
Gmail to Gmail's website and then Gmail
would show me my email without some kind

176
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:08,190
would show me my email without some kind
 

177
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,520

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,670
out to be easy to attack and the one
style of attack is that what's called a

00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
style of attack is that what's called a
 

185
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,620
style of attack is that what's called a
man-in-the-middle attack where some evil

186
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:21,630
man-in-the-middle attack where some evil
 

187
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,820
man-in-the-middle attack where some evil
person sets up a another web server that

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:34,500
and password right and then the attacker
 

195
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,110
and password right and then the attacker
would maybe intercept my DNS packets or

would maybe intercept my DNS packets or
 

197
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,689
would maybe intercept my DNS packets or
just guess when I would have sent a DNS

198
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:41,699
just guess when I would have sent a DNS
 

199
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,820
just guess when I would have sent a DNS
packet and come up with a fake reply

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,500
would provide the email address of ma of
the attackers fake computer and then the

the attackers fake computer and then the
 

209
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,870
the attackers fake computer and then the
user's browser instead of talking to

user's browser instead of talking to
 

211

this is the attack in the mid-90s people
came up with certificates with SSL or

came up with certificates with SSL or

came up with certificates with SSL or
it's also called TLS it's what the

it's also called TLS it's what the
 

273
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,920
it's also called TLS it's what the

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,110
you're using when you use HTTPS links um
and here the game was that Gmail comm

278
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,120
and here the game was that Gmail comm
 

279
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,870
and here the game was that Gmail comm
was gonna have a public/private key pair

280
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
was gonna have a public/private key pair
 

281
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,150
was gonna have a public/private key pair
so we'd have a private key that only

282
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
so we'd have a private key that only
 

283
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,270
so we'd have a private key that only
Gmail knows sitting in its server and

Gmail knows sitting in its server and
 

285
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,780
Gmail knows sitting in its server and
then when you connect well your the user

286
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:41,790
then when you connect well your the user
 

287
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,420
then when you connect well your the user
you connect somewhere you ask to connect

you connect somewhere you ask to connect
 

289
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,500
you connect somewhere you ask to connect
to Gmail you know and in order to verify

290
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:48,510
to Gmail you know and in order to verify
 

291
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,390
to Gmail you know and in order to verify
that you're really talking to Gmail the

292
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
that you're really talking to Gmail the
 

293
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,580
that you're really talking to Gmail the
users going to demand Gmail prove that

294
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:52,590
users going to demand Gmail prove that
 

295
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,130
users going to demand Gmail prove that
it really owns Gmail is private key well

296
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:55,140
it really owns Gmail is private key well
 

297
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,850
it really owns Gmail is private key well
of course

298
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:55,860
of course
 

299
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,610
of course
where does your browser find out Gmail

300
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:58,620
where does your browser find out Gmail
 

301
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,040
where does your browser find out Gmail
is private key from your Gmail public

302
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,050
is private key from your Gmail public
 

303
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,860
is private key from your Gmail public
key which is what you need to check that

304
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:03,870
key which is what you need to check that
 

305
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,330
key which is what you need to check that
it really has the private key there's

306
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:05,340
it really has the private key there's
 

307
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,820
it really has the private key there's
also this notion of certificate

308
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:07,830
also this notion of certificate
 

309
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,380
also this notion of certificate
authorities and certificates so there'd

310
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:09,390
authorities and certificates so there'd
 

311
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,900
authorities and certificates so there'd
be a certificate authority when Gmail

312
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:11,910
be a certificate authority when Gmail
 

313
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,719
be a certificate authority when Gmail
set up its server it would contact the

314
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:14,729
set up its server it would contact the
 

315
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:15,950
set up its server it would contact the
certificate authority may be on the

316
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:15,960
certificate authority may be on the
 

317
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,300
certificate authority may be on the
phone or by email or something and say

318
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:17,310
phone or by email or something and say
 

319
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,360
phone or by email or something and say
look you know I want a certificate for

320
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,370
look you know I want a certificate for
 

321
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,990
look you know I want a certificate for
the DNS name gmail.com and the

322
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
the DNS name gmail.com and the
 

323
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,969
the DNS name gmail.com and the
certificate authority would sort of try

324
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:25,979
certificate authority would sort of try
 

325
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,159
certificate authority would sort of try
to verify that oh yes whoever's asking

326
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:28,169
to verify that oh yes whoever's asking
 

327
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:30,409
to verify that oh yes whoever's asking
for certificate really owns that name

328
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:30,419
for certificate really owns that name
 

329
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,120
for certificate really owns that name
it really is Google or whoever owns

330
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,130
it really is Google or whoever owns
 

331
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,270
it really is Google or whoever owns
gmail.com and if so the certificate

332
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
gmail.com and if so the certificate
 

333
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,340
gmail.com and if so the certificate
authority would provide a certificate

334
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:39,350

 

335
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,830

back to gee

336
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:40,840
back to gee
 

337
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,080
back to gee
komm which basically what a certificate

338
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,090
komm which basically what a certificate
 

339
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:50,000
komm which basically what a certificate
contains is the name of the web server

340
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,010
contains is the name of the web server
 

341
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:57,110
contains is the name of the web server
the web servers public key and a

342
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
the web servers public key and a
 

343
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,770
the web servers public key and a
signature over this certificate made

344
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:01,780
signature over this certificate made
 

345
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,530
signature over this certificate made
with the certificate authorities private

346
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:04,540
with the certificate authorities private
 

347
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,030
with the certificate authorities private
key so this is sort of a self-contained

348
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,040
key so this is sort of a self-contained
 

349
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,070
key so this is sort of a self-contained
assertion checkable by checking the

350
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,080
assertion checkable by checking the
 

351
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,210
assertion checkable by checking the
signature an assertion by the

352
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:12,220
signature an assertion by the
 

353
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,300
signature an assertion by the
certificate authority that the public

354
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,310
certificate authority that the public
 

355
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,210
certificate authority that the public
key of gmail.com is really this public

356
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:18,220
key of gmail.com is really this public
 

357
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,330
key of gmail.com is really this public
key gmail.com server would I just keep a

358
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:21,340
key gmail.com server would I just keep a
 

359
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,480
key gmail.com server would I just keep a
copy of the certificate if you connect

360
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:23,490
copy of the certificate if you connect
 

361
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,000
copy of the certificate if you connect
to gmail.com server with HTTPS the first

362
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,010
to gmail.com server with HTTPS the first
 

363
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,200
to gmail.com server with HTTPS the first
thing it does is sends you back this

364
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,210
thing it does is sends you back this
 

365
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,159
thing it does is sends you back this
certificate at this point is just a

366
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,169
certificate at this point is just a
 

367
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,420
certificate at this point is just a
certificate right now of course since

368
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:33,430
certificate right now of course since
 

369
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,130
certificate right now of course since
gmail.com is willing to give it to

370
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:35,140
gmail.com is willing to give it to
 

371
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,500
gmail.com is willing to give it to
anybody it's the certificate itself is

372
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:37,510
anybody it's the certificate itself is
 

373
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,969
anybody it's the certificate itself is
not at all pregnant it's quite public

374
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:38,979
not at all pregnant it's quite public
 

375
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,810
not at all pregnant it's quite public
and then the browser would send some

376
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:42,820
and then the browser would send some
 

377
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,550
and then the browser would send some
information like a random number for

378
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560
information like a random number for
 

379
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,720
information like a random number for
example to the server and ask it to sign

380
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:48,730
example to the server and ask it to sign
 

381
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,340
example to the server and ask it to sign
it with its private key and then the

382
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,350
it with its private key and then the
 

383
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,079
it with its private key and then the
browser can check using the public key

384
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:55,089
browser can check using the public key
 

385
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:57,780
browser can check using the public key
in the certificate that the random

386
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:57,790
in the certificate that the random
 

387
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,190
in the certificate that the random
number is ran and remember was really

388
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
number is ran and remember was really
 

389
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,670
number is ran and remember was really
signed by the private key that's

390
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:02,680
signed by the private key that's
 

391
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,990
signed by the private key that's
associated with the public key in the

392
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
associated with the public key in the
 

393
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,970
associated with the public key in the
certificate and therefore that whoever

394
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:05,980
certificate and therefore that whoever
 

395
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,790
certificate and therefore that whoever
it's talking to is really the entity

396
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
it's talking to is really the entity
 

397
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,500
it's talking to is really the entity
that the certificate authority believes

398
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:10,510
that the certificate authority believes
 

399
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,130
that the certificate authority believes
is gmail.com all right and now the

400
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,140
is gmail.com all right and now the
 

401
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,269
is gmail.com all right and now the
reason why this makes man-in-the-middle

402
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
reason why this makes man-in-the-middle
 

403
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,340
reason why this makes man-in-the-middle
attacks much harder is that yeah you

404
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:17,350
attacks much harder is that yeah you
 

405
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,940
attacks much harder is that yeah you
know you can set up a rogue server that

406
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:20,950
know you can set up a rogue server that
 

407
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,550
know you can set up a rogue server that
looks just like Gmail calm and maybe you

408
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:23,560
looks just like Gmail calm and maybe you
 

409
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,410
looks just like Gmail calm and maybe you
can even hack the DNS system indeed you

410
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:25,420
can even hack the DNS system indeed you
 

411
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,930
can even hack the DNS system indeed you
still can if you're sufficiently clever

412
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:27,940
still can if you're sufficiently clever
 

413
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,370
still can if you're sufficiently clever
powerful hack the DNS system to tell

414
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:32,380
powerful hack the DNS system to tell
 

415
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,380
powerful hack the DNS system to tell
people's browsers that oh they should go

416
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:34,390
people's browsers that oh they should go
 

417
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,930
people's browsers that oh they should go
to your server instead of gmail.com but

418
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:36,940
to your server instead of gmail.com but
 

419
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,970
to your server instead of gmail.com but
once somebody's browser contacts your

420
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:38,980
once somebody's browser contacts your
 

421
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,990
once somebody's browser contacts your
server

422
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
server
 

423
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,030
server
you're not presumably going to be able

424
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,040
you're not presumably going to be able
 

425
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,110
you're not presumably going to be able
to produce a certificate that says but

426
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,120
to produce a certificate that says but
 

427
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,880
to produce a certificate that says but
you you can produce Gmail certificate

428
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:47,890
you you can produce Gmail certificate
 

429
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,160
you you can produce Gmail certificate
but then Gmail certificate as Gmail's

430
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,170
but then Gmail certificate as Gmail's
 

431
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,750
but then Gmail certificate as Gmail's
public key your server doesn't have

432
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:51,760
public key your server doesn't have
 

433
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,810
public key your server doesn't have
their private key so you can

434
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:53,820
their private key so you can
 

435
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,540
their private key so you can
sign the challenge the browser sent you

436
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:55,550
sign the challenge the browser sent you
 

437
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,310
sign the challenge the browser sent you
and presumably since you're not the real

438
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
and presumably since you're not the real
 

439
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,160
and presumably since you're not the real
Google and not the real Gmail you're not

440
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,170
Google and not the real Gmail you're not
 

441
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:01,910
Google and not the real Gmail you're not
going to be able to persuade a

442
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:01,920
going to be able to persuade a
 

443
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,440
going to be able to persuade a
certificate authority to give you a

444
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,450
certificate authority to give you a
 

445
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,650
certificate authority to give you a
certificate associating gmail comm with

446
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:06,660
certificate associating gmail comm with
 

447
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,880
certificate associating gmail comm with
your public key that unit and so this

448
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:10,890
your public key that unit and so this
 

449
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,780
your public key that unit and so this
certificate scheme made

450
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:11,790
certificate scheme made
 

451
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,040
certificate scheme made
man-in-the-middle attacks quite a bit

452
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,050
man-in-the-middle attacks quite a bit
 

453
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,690
man-in-the-middle attacks quite a bit
harder and you know indeed they are

454
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:14,700
harder and you know indeed they are
 

455
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,670
harder and you know indeed they are
quite a bit harder now because of

456
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:16,680
quite a bit harder now because of
 

457
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,800
quite a bit harder now because of
certificates okay so it turns out though

458
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:21,810
certificates okay so it turns out though
 

459
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,950
certificates okay so it turns out though
that the certificate scheme as people

460
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:24,960
that the certificate scheme as people
 

461
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,670
that the certificate scheme as people
now have a lot of experience with it

462
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:27,680
now have a lot of experience with it
 

463
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,500
now have a lot of experience with it
almost 25 years experience within so we

464
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:30,510
almost 25 years experience within so we
 

465
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,540
almost 25 years experience within so we
now know there's some kind of things

466
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:32,550
now know there's some kind of things
 

467
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,550
now know there's some kind of things
that go wrong it was originally imagined

468
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
that go wrong it was originally imagined
 

469
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,800
that go wrong it was originally imagined
that there would just be a couple of

470
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:35,810
that there would just be a couple of
 

471
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,450
that there would just be a couple of
trustworthy certificate authorities who

472
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:38,460
trustworthy certificate authorities who
 

473
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,160
trustworthy certificate authorities who
would do a good job of checking that

474
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,170
would do a good job of checking that
 

475
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,560
would do a good job of checking that
request really came from who they

476
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:42,570
request really came from who they
 

477
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,850
request really came from who they
claimed to come from that if somebody

478
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:43,860
claimed to come from that if somebody
 

479
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,260
claimed to come from that if somebody
asked for a certificate for gmail.com

480
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:45,270
asked for a certificate for gmail.com
 

481
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,940
asked for a certificate for gmail.com
that this certificate authorities would

482
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:46,950
that this certificate authorities would
 

483

that this certificate authorities would
indeed actually verified that the

484
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:49,260
indeed actually verified that the
 

485
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,510
indeed actually verified that the
request came from the owner gmail.com

486
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:50,520
request came from the owner gmail.com
 

487
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,480
request came from the owner gmail.com
and not hand out certificates to random

488
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:53,490
and not hand out certificates to random
 

489
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,590
and not hand out certificates to random
people for gmail comp but it that turns

490
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
people for gmail comp but it that turns
 

491
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,200
people for gmail comp but it that turns
out to be very challenging for google

492
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,210
out to be very challenging for google
 

493
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,900
out to be very challenging for google
maybe you can convince this certificate

494
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:02,910
maybe you can convince this certificate
 

495
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,610
maybe you can convince this certificate
authority can convince itself that a

496
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:04,620
authority can convince itself that a
 

497
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,440
authority can convince itself that a
request comes from Google but you know

498
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,450
request comes from Google but you know
 

499
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,770
request comes from Google but you know
for just XCOM that's very hard to have a

500
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:09,780
for just XCOM that's very hard to have a
 

501
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,660
for just XCOM that's very hard to have a
certificate authority reliably able to

502
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:11,670
certificate authority reliably able to
 

503
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,090
certificate authority reliably able to
say oh yeah gosh this request really

504
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:14,100
say oh yeah gosh this request really
 

505
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,190
say oh yeah gosh this request really
came from the person who really does own

506
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:16,200
came from the person who really does own
 

507
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,690
came from the person who really does own
the DMS name XCOM all right a worse

508
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:20,700
the DMS name XCOM all right a worse
 

509
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,630
the DMS name XCOM all right a worse
problem is that while originally they

510
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:23,640
problem is that while originally they
 

511
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,040
problem is that while originally they
were envisioned there'd be only a few

512
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,050
were envisioned there'd be only a few
 

513
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,360
were envisioned there'd be only a few
certificate authority there are now

514
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:26,370
certificate authority there are now
 

515
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,130
certificate authority there are now
literally hundreds of certificate

516
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:28,140
literally hundreds of certificate
 

517
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,800
literally hundreds of certificate
authorities out there and any

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:30,810
authorities out there and any
 

519
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,140
authorities out there and any
certificate authority can generate a

520
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,150
certificate authority can generate a
 

521
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:38,060
certificate authority can generate a
certificate for any name and indeed may

522
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,070
certificate for any name and indeed may

want to you're allowed to change

524
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:39,480
want to you're allowed to change
 

525
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,940
want to you're allowed to change
certificate authorities if you're a

526
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:40,950
certificate authorities if you're a
 

527
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,980
certificate authorities if you're a
website owner you can change certificate

528
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:42,990
website owner you can change certificate
 

529
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,580
website owner you can change certificate
authority to whoever you like so there's

530
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:46,590
authority to whoever you like so there's
 

531
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,080
authority to whoever you like so there's
no sense in which certificate

no sense in which certificate
 

533
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,370
no sense in which certificate

authorities have limits on their powers
 

535
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,710

they can any certificate authority can

536
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:51,720
they can any certificate authority can
 

537
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,420
they can any certificate authority can
produce any certificate and now browsers

538
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:56,430
produce any certificate and now browsers
 

539
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,770
produce any certificate and now browsers
have you know there's a couple hundred

540
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:57,780
have you know there's a couple hundred
 

541
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,300
have you know there's a couple hundred
certificate authorities and that means

542
00:11:59,300 --> 00:11:59,310
certificate authorities and that means
 

543
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,890
certificate authorities and that means
that each browser has built into it like

544
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:00,900
that each browser has built into it like
 

545
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,200
that each browser has built into it like
Chrome or Firefox or something has built

the certificate all couple hundred sort

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:07,320
the certificate all couple hundred sort
 

551
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,680
the certificate all couple hundred sort
good authorities and if any of them sign

server certificates acceptable the
 

557
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,830
server certificates acceptable the
result of this is that there have been

result of this is that there have been
 

559
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,170
result of this is that there have been
multiple incidents of certificate

that is producing certificates that said

and you know sometimes this happens just

578
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:47,850
and you know sometimes this happens just
 

579
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,030
and you know sometimes this happens just
by mistake because superior Authority

580
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,040
by mistake because superior Authority
 

581
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,460
by mistake because superior Authority
doesn't realize that they're doing the

582

doesn't realize that they're doing the
 

583
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,870
doesn't realize that they're doing the
wrong thing and sometimes it's actually

584
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:53,880
wrong thing and sometimes it's actually
 

585
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,070
wrong thing and sometimes it's actually
quite malicious I mean there have

586
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:55,080
quite malicious I mean there have
 

587
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,620
quite malicious I mean there have
certainly been certificates issued to

00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:57,630
certainly been certificates issued to
 

589
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,870
certainly been certificates issued to
people who just wanted to snoop on

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:07,740
readings are mentioned a couple of these
 

599
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,950
readings are mentioned a couple of these
incidents and they're particularly

600
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:09,960
incidents and they're particularly
 

601
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,110
incidents and they're particularly
troubling because they're hard to

602
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,120
troubling because they're hard to
 

603
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,910
troubling because they're hard to
prevent because there's so many

604
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
prevent because there's so many
 

605
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,530
prevent because there's so many
certificate authorities and not all of

606

00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,410
although sorry the last question let was
 

611
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,290
although sorry the last question let was
the last line insert box it's a

612
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:21,300
the last line insert box it's a
 

613
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,510
the last line insert box it's a
signature over the certificate by the

614

signature over the certificate by the
 

615
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,730
signature over the certificate by the

authorities using the certificate
 

619
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:32,000
authorities using the certificate
authorities private key okay so there

620
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,010
authorities private key okay so there
 

621
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,590
authorities private key okay so there
have been incidents of bogus

622
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
have been incidents of bogus
 

623
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
have been incidents of bogus
certificates certificates for real

624
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:35,610
certificates certificates for real
 

625
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,360
certificates certificates for real
websites like Google issued to totally

626
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:38,370
websites like Google issued to totally
 

627
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,130
websites like Google issued to totally
the wrong people and those certificates

628
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:40,140
the wrong people and those certificates
 

629
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,610
the wrong people and those certificates
have been abused and it's not clear how

630
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:43,620
have been abused and it's not clear how
 

631
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,440
have been abused and it's not clear how
to fix the certificate authority system

632
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:45,450
to fix the certificate authority system
 

633
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,960
to fix the certificate authority system
itself to prevent them because there's

634
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:47,970
itself to prevent them because there's
 

635
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,900
itself to prevent them because there's
so many certificate authorities and they

636
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:50,910
so many certificate authorities and they
 

637
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,200
so many certificate authorities and they
really you just can't expect that

638
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,210
really you just can't expect that
 

639
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,660
really you just can't expect that
they're going to be completely reliable

640
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:55,670
they're going to be completely reliable
 

641
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,530
they're going to be completely reliable
so what can we do about this one

642
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:00,540
so what can we do about this one
 

643
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,230
so what can we do about this one
possibility would be to have a single

644
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:03,240
possibility would be to have a single
 

645
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,240
possibility would be to have a single

to cause all the information to be

00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:53,569
you know maybe people it'll still allow
people to issue bogus certificates but

770
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:53,579
people to issue bogus certificates but
 

771
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,900
people to issue bogus certificates but
it's gonna insure those certificates are

772
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:55,910
it's gonna insure those certificates are
 

773
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,369
it's gonna insure those certificates are
public and that everybody can see them

774

certificate and so this fixes the

781
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:10,309

00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,480
have come to light have generally been
discovered only by accident not because

810
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:41,490
discovered only by accident not because
 

811
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,249
discovered only by accident not because
they were sort of foredoomed to be

00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:43,259
they were sort of foredoomed to be
 

813
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:46,210
they were sort of foredoomed to be
discovered so instead of relying on

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:46,220
discovered so instead of relying on
 

815
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,049
discovered so instead of relying on
accidental discovery of bogus

816
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:48,059
accidental discovery of bogus

certificates certificate transparency

818
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:50,549
certificates certificate transparency
 

819
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:51,830
certificates certificate transparency
it's going to sort of force them into

820
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
it's going to sort of force them into
 

821
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,320
it's going to sort of force them into
the light where they is much easier to

822
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:54,330
the light where they is much easier to
 

823
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,379
the light where they is much easier to
notice them again so it has a sort of

824
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:57,389
notice them again so it has a sort of
 

825
00:17:57,389 --> 00:17:59,720
notice them again so it has a sort of
audit flavor or nada not a prevention

826
00:17:59,720 --> 00:17:59,730
audit flavor or nada not a prevention
 

827
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:04,279

flavor okay so the basic structure again

they're gonna ask someone of the

00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:12,659
they're gonna ask someone of the

when when the cert web servers first set
 

839
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:21,769
when when the cert web servers first set
up so we're gonna ask a certificate and

840
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:21,779
up so we're gonna ask a certificate and
 

841
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:23,749
up so we're gonna ask a certificate and
the certificate authority is gonna send

842
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:23,759
the certificate authority is gonna send
 

843
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:26,810
the certificate authority is gonna send

this certificate back to the web server
 

845

because of course is the web server that
gives a certificate to the browser and

gives a certificate to the browser and

gives a certificate to the browser and
at the same time though the certificate

it's gonna append it to its log so this

Gmail Gmail sends them a certificate
back and the browser's gonna send that

back and the browser's gonna send that
 

899
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:40,440
back and the browser's gonna send that

server see is this certificate in the
 

903
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,379
server see is this certificate in the
log there's difficut log servers gonna

904
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:46,389
log there's difficut log servers gonna
 

905
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:48,329
log there's difficut log servers gonna
say yes or no is their certificate in

906
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:48,339
say yes or no is their certificate in
 

907
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:50,519
say yes or no is their certificate in
the log now and if it is then the

908
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:50,529
the log now and if it is then the
 

909
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:53,879
the log now and if it is then the
browser will go ahead and use it now the

910
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:53,889
browser will go ahead and use it now the
 

911
00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:55,499
browser will go ahead and use it now the
fact that it's in the log you know

912
00:19:55,499 --> 00:19:55,509
fact that it's in the log you know
 

913
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:56,879
fact that it's in the log you know
doesn't mean it's not bogus right

914
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:56,889
doesn't mean it's not bogus right
 

915
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:58,649
doesn't mean it's not bogus right
because any certificate authority

916
00:19:58,649 --> 00:19:58,659
because any certificate authority
 

917
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:00,779
because any certificate authority
including the ones that are out there

918
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:00,789
including the ones that are out there
 

919
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:03,359
including the ones that are out there
that are malicious or badly run any

920
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:03,369
that are malicious or badly run any
 

921
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,479
that are malicious or badly run any
certificate authority can insert a

922
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:06,489
certificate authority can insert a
 

923
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:09,440
certificate authority can insert a
certificate into the log system and

924
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:09,450
certificate into the log system and
 

925
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,289
certificate into the log system and
therefore perhaps trick users into using

926
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:13,299
therefore perhaps trick users into using
 

927
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:14,579
therefore perhaps trick users into using
it so for so far we haven't built a

928
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:14,589
it so for so far we haven't built a
 

929
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:20,039
it so for so far we haven't built a
system that prevents abuse however it is

930
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:20,049
system that prevents abuse however it is
 

931
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:22,499
system that prevents abuse however it is
the case that no browser will use a

932
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:22,509
the case that no browser will use a
 

933
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:25,349
the case that no browser will use a
certificate unless it's in the log so at

934
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:25,359
certificate unless it's in the log so at
 

935
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:29,399
certificate unless it's in the log so at
the same time gmail is going to run up

936
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:29,409
the same time gmail is going to run up
 

937
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:34,639
the same time gmail is going to run up
with the CT system calls a monitor and

938
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:34,649
with the CT system calls a monitor and
 

939
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:36,060
with the CT system calls a monitor and
for now well

940
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,070
for now well
 

941
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,290
for now well
just assume that there's a monitor

942
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:37,300
just assume that there's a monitor
 

943
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,780
just assume that there's a monitor
associated with every website so this

944
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:39,790
associated with every website so this
 

945
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:44,280
associated with every website so this
monitor periodically also talks to the

946
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,290
monitor periodically also talks to the
 

947
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,400
monitor periodically also talks to the
certificate log servers an asset please

948
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,410
certificate log servers an asset please
 

949
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,140
certificate log servers an asset please
give me a copy of your log or really you

950
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,150
give me a copy of your log or really you
 

951
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,120
give me a copy of your log or really you
know please give me a copy of whatever

952
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,130
know please give me a copy of whatever
 

953
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,530
know please give me a copy of whatever
new has been added to your long since I

954
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:52,540
new has been added to your long since I
 

955
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,270
new has been added to your long since I
last asked and that means that the

956
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,280
last asked and that means that the
 

957
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,800
last asked and that means that the
monitor is going to build up it's going

958
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:55,810
monitor is going to build up it's going
 

959
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,110
monitor is going to build up it's going
to be aware of every single certificate

960
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,120
to be aware of every single certificate
 

961
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,240
to be aware of every single certificate
that's going to be enough that's in the

962
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,250
that's going to be enough that's in the
 

963
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,060
that's going to be enough that's in the
log and but also because the monitor is

964
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,070
log and but also because the monitor is
 

965
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,550
log and but also because the monitor is
associated with Gmail the monitor knows

966
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:05,560
associated with Gmail the monitor knows
 

967
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,990
associated with Gmail the monitor knows
what Gmail's correct certificate is so

968
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,000
what Gmail's correct certificate is so
 

969
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,120
what Gmail's correct certificate is so
if some rogue certificate authority

970
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,130
if some rogue certificate authority
 

971
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,340
if some rogue certificate authority
issues a certificate for Gmail it's not

972
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:14,350
issues a certificate for Gmail it's not
 

973
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,360
issues a certificate for Gmail it's not
the one that Gmail itself asked for then

974
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:18,370
the one that Gmail itself asked for then
 

975
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,970
the one that Gmail itself asked for then
Gmail's monitor will stumble across it

976
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:20,980
Gmail's monitor will stumble across it
 

977
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,870
Gmail's monitor will stumble across it
in the certificate log because Gmail's

978
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:24,880
in the certificate log because Gmail's
 

979
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,580
in the certificate log because Gmail's
monitor knows Gmail's correct

980
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:26,590
monitor knows Gmail's correct
 

981
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,460
monitor knows Gmail's correct
certificate now of course the rogue

982
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:29,470
certificate now of course the rogue
 

983
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,900
certificate now of course the rogue
certificate authority doesn't have to

984
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:30,910
certificate authority doesn't have to
 

985
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,760
certificate authority doesn't have to
send its certificate to the certificate

986
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:32,770
send its certificate to the certificate
 

987
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,140
send its certificate to the certificate
log system but in that case when

988
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,150
log system but in that case when
 

989
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,380
log system but in that case when
browsers you know maybe accidentally

990
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,390
browsers you know maybe accidentally
 

991
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,920
browsers you know maybe accidentally
connect to the attackers web server and

992
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:40,930
connect to the attackers web server and
 

993
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,300
connect to the attackers web server and
the attacker would swipe server gives

994
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,310
the attacker would swipe server gives
 

995
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,770
the attacker would swipe server gives
them the bogus certificate if they

996
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:43,780
them the bogus certificate if they
 

997
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,780
them the bogus certificate if they
haven't put it in the log then the

998
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:45,790
haven't put it in the log then the
 

999
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,430
haven't put it in the log then the
browser won't believe it and will abort

1000
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:47,440
browser won't believe it and will abort
 

1001
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,840
browser won't believe it and will abort
the connection it's not because it's not

1002
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:48,850
the connection it's not because it's not
 

1003
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,650
the connection it's not because it's not
in the log

1004
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:49,660
in the log
 

1005
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,430
in the log
so the log sort of forces because

1006
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,440
so the log sort of forces because
 

1007
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,530
so the log sort of forces because
browsers require certificates being a

1008
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:55,540
browsers require certificates being a
 

1009
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,990
browsers require certificates being a
log the log forces all certificates to

1010
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,000
log the log forces all certificates to
 

1011
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,240
log the log forces all certificates to
be public where they can be audited and

1012
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,250
be public where they can be audited and
 

1013
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,840
be public where they can be audited and
checked by monitors who know what the

1014
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:03,850
checked by monitors who know what the
 

1015
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,880
checked by monitors who know what the
proper certificates our and so some

1016
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:05,890
proper certificates our and so some
 

1017
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,620
proper certificates our and so some
monitors are run by big companies and

1018
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:07,630
monitors are run by big companies and
 

1019
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,380
monitors are run by big companies and
companies know their own certificates

1020
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:10,390
companies know their own certificates
 

1021
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,510
companies know their own certificates
some monitors are run by certificate

1022
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:12,520
some monitors are run by certificate
 

1023
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,070
some monitors are run by certificate

authorities on behalf of their customers
 

1025
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,810
authorities on behalf of their customers
and again those certificate authorities

1026
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:15,820
and again those certificate authorities
 

1027
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,490
and again those certificate authorities
know what certificates they've issued to

1028
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:17,500
know what certificates they've issued to
 

1029
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,350
know what certificates they've issued to
their customers and they can at least

1030
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,360
their customers and they can at least
 

1031
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,150
their customers and they can at least
alert their customers if they see a

00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:23,560
certificate they didn't issue for one of
 

1035
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,130
certificate they didn't issue for one of
their customers names I'm in addition

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,590
their customers names I'm in addition
there's some totally third-party monitor

1038
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:28,600
there's some totally third-party monitor
 

1039
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,750
there's some totally third-party monitor
systems where you give the third-party

1040
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:30,760
systems where you give the third-party
 

1041
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,170
systems where you give the third-party
monitor your names and yours and your

1042
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:34,180
monitor your names and yours and your
 

1043
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,010
monitor your names and yours and your
valid certificates and it checks for

1044
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,020
valid certificates and it checks for
 

1045
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,350
valid certificates and it checks for
expected certificates for your names

1046

expected certificates for your names
 

1047
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,120
expected certificates for your names
alright this is the overall scheme but

1048
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,130
alright this is the overall scheme but
 

1049
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,650
alright this is the overall scheme but
it depends very much on browsers seeing

1050
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:51,660
it depends very much on browsers seeing
 

1051
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,650
it depends very much on browsers seeing
the very same log contents that monitors

1052
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:54,660
the very same log contents that monitors
 

1053
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:59,120
the very same log contents that monitors
see and but remember we were up against

1054
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,130
see and but remember we were up against
 

1055
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,620
see and but remember we were up against
this problem that we're not sure that we

1056
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:00,630
this problem that we're not sure that we
 

1057
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,390
this problem that we're not sure that we
can trust any component in this system

1058
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:02,400
can trust any component in this system
 

1059
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,460
can trust any component in this system
so indeed we found this certificate

1060
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:04,470
so indeed we found this certificate
 

1061
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,260
so indeed we found this certificate
authorities some of them are malicious

1062
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,270
authorities some of them are malicious
 

1063
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,940
authorities some of them are malicious
or have employees who can't be trusted

1064
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:07,950
or have employees who can't be trusted
 

1065
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,000
or have employees who can't be trusted
or are sloppy and don't follow the rules

1066
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,010
or are sloppy and don't follow the rules
 

1067
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,070
or are sloppy and don't follow the rules
so we're going to assume we have to

1068
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:13,080
so we're going to assume we have to
 

1069
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,780
so we're going to assume we have to
assume that the same will be true the

1070
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:14,790
assume that the same will be true the
 

1071
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,640
assume that the same will be true the
certificate log servers that some of

1072
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:16,650
certificate log servers that some of
 

1073
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,650
certificate log servers that some of
them will be malicious some of them may

1074
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:18,660
them will be malicious some of them may
 

1075
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,710
them will be malicious some of them may
conspire with rogue certificate

1076
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:21,720
conspire with rogue certificate
 

1077
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,120
conspire with rogue certificate
authorities and intentionally try to

1078
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,130
authorities and intentionally try to
 

1079
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,830
authorities and intentionally try to
help them issue bogus certificates some

1080
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
help them issue bogus certificates some
 

1081
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
help them issue bogus certificates some
of them may be sloppy some of them may

1082
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:29,850
of them may be sloppy some of them may
 

1083
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,640
of them may be sloppy some of them may
be legitimate but maybe some of their

1084
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:31,650
be legitimate but maybe some of their
 

1085
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,980
be legitimate but maybe some of their
employees or are corruptible you pay

1086
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:33,990
employees or are corruptible you pay
 

1087
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,380
employees or are corruptible you pay
them being a bribe so I'll do something

1088
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:36,390
them being a bribe so I'll do something
 

1089
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,090
them being a bribe so I'll do something
funny to the log delete something or add

1090
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:38,100
funny to the log delete something or add
 

1091
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,090
funny to the log delete something or add
something to it so what we need to build

1092
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:41,100
something to it so what we need to build
 

1093
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,070
something to it so what we need to build
is a log that even though the log

1094
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,080
is a log that even though the log
 

1095
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,150
is a log that even though the log
operator may be not cooperating not

1096
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:47,160
operator may be not cooperating not
 

1097
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,270
operator may be not cooperating not
trustworthy we can still be sure or at

1098
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:50,280
trustworthy we can still be sure or at
 

1099
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,360
trustworthy we can still be sure or at
least know if it's not the case that

1100
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:52,370
least know if it's not the case that
 

1101
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,770
least know if it's not the case that
browsers are seeing the same log contest

1102
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:54,780
browsers are seeing the same log contest
 

1103
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,900
browsers are seeing the same log contest
as monitors so if our browser uses a

1104
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:56,910
as monitors so if our browser uses a
 

1105
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,750
as monitors so if our browser uses a
certificate that was in the log the

1106
00:23:59,750 --> 00:23:59,760
certificate that was in the log the
 

1107
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,460
certificate that was in the log the
monitor who owns that name will

1108
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:01,470
monitor who owns that name will
 

1109
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,870
monitor who owns that name will
eventually see it so what we need to do

1110
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:05,880
eventually see it so what we need to do
 

1111
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:13,580
eventually see it so what we need to do
is we need to build a log system that is

1112
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:13,590
is we need to build a log system that is
 

1113
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,910
is we need to build a log system that is
append-only so that it can't show a

1114
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:16,920
append-only so that it can't show a
 

1115
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,330
append-only so that it can't show a
certificate to a browser then delete it

1116
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:20,340
certificate to a browser then delete it
 

1117
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:27,100
certificate to a browser then delete it
before monitors see it so append-only

1118
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,110

 

1119
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,940

no Forks

1120
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:28,950
no Forks
 

1121
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,830
no Forks
in the sense that we don't want the log

1122
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:33,840
in the sense that we don't want the log
 

1123
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,170
in the sense that we don't want the log
system to basically keep two logs one of

1124
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:36,180
system to basically keep two logs one of
 

1125
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,900
system to basically keep two logs one of
which it shows two browsers and one of

1126
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:38,910
which it shows two browsers and one of
 

1127
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,870
which it shows two browsers and one of
which shows two monitors so we need no

1128
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:41,880
which shows two monitors so we need no
 

1129
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:53,540
which shows two monitors so we need no
Forks and we need untrusted we can't be

1130
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:53,550
Forks and we need untrusted we can't be
 

1131
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,960
Forks and we need untrusted we can't be
sure that the certificate servers are

1132
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:56,970
sure that the certificate servers are
 

1133
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:02,200
sure that the certificate servers are
correct so just to back up a bit the

1134
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,210
correct so just to back up a bit the
 

1135
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,690
correct so just to back up a bit the
critical properties we need for the log

1136
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:05,700
critical properties we need for the log
 

1137
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,510
critical properties we need for the log
system so larger than just a log servers

1138
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:08,520
system so larger than just a log servers
 

1139
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,940
system so larger than just a log servers
but the entire system of the log servers

1140
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:10,950
but the entire system of the log servers
 

1141
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,030
but the entire system of the log servers
plus the various checks is we have to

1142
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:14,040
plus the various checks is we have to
 

1143
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,660
plus the various checks is we have to
prevent deletion that is we need the

1144
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:16,670
prevent deletion that is we need the
 

1145
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,790
prevent deletion that is we need the
logs to be append only because if a log

1146
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:19,800
logs to be append only because if a log
 

1147
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,410
logs to be append only because if a log
server could delete items out of its log

1148
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:24,420
server could delete items out of its log
 

1149
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,870
server could delete items out of its log
then they could effectively show a bogus

1150
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:26,880
then they could effectively show a bogus
 

1151
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,390
then they could effectively show a bogus
certificate to a browser claimants in

1152
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:29,400
certificate to a browser claimants in
 

1153
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,010
certificate to a browser claimants in
the long and maybe in the log at that

1154
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:31,020
the long and maybe in the log at that
 

1155
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,130
the long and maybe in the log at that
time the browser uses it but then maybe

1156
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:34,140
time the browser uses it but then maybe
 

1157
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,840
time the browser uses it but then maybe
this certificate server could delete

1158
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:35,850
this certificate server could delete
 

1159
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:38,810
this certificate server could delete
that certificate from its log so that by

1160
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:38,820
that certificate from its log so that by
 

1161
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,160
that certificate from its log so that by
the time the monitor's came to look at

1162
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,170
the time the monitor's came to look at
 

1163
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,170
the time the monitor's came to look at
the log the bogus certificate wouldn't

1164
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:42,180
the log the bogus certificate wouldn't
 

1165
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,720
the log the bogus certificate wouldn't
be there so we need to have a system

1166
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:44,730
be there so we need to have a system
 

1167
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,880
be there so we need to have a system
that either prevents deletion or at

1168
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:46,890
that either prevents deletion or at
 

1169
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,520
that either prevents deletion or at
least detects if deletion occurred so

1170
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:49,530
least detects if deletion occurred so
 

1171
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:52,130
least detects if deletion occurred so
that's the sense in which the system

1172
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:52,140
that's the sense in which the system
 

1173
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,030
that's the sense in which the system
needs to be append-only and we also have

1174
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,040
needs to be append-only and we also have
 

1175
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,130
needs to be append-only and we also have
to prevent what's called equivocation or

1176
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:00,140
to prevent what's called equivocation or
 

1177
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,740
to prevent what's called equivocation or
not' we have to prevent Forks or

1178
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:02,750
not' we have to prevent Forks or
 

1179
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:08,910
not' we have to prevent Forks or
equivalently equivocation

1180
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:08,920

 

1181
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,530

so you know it's

1182
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:12,540
so you know it's
 

1183
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,440
so you know it's
maybe the certificate log servers could

1184
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:15,450
maybe the certificate log servers could
 

1185
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,810
maybe the certificate log servers could
be implementing append-only logs but if

1186
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:17,820
be implementing append-only logs but if
 

1187
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,050
be implementing append-only logs but if
it if it uh implemented two different

1188
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:21,060
it if it uh implemented two different
 

1189
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,560
it if it uh implemented two different
depend the only logs and showed one two

1190
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:23,570
depend the only logs and showed one two
 

1191
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,520
depend the only logs and showed one two
browsers and show the other append-only

1192
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:25,530
browsers and show the other append-only
 

1193
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,980
browsers and show the other append-only
log two monitors then we could be in a

1194
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:27,990
log two monitors then we could be in a
 

1195
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,140
log two monitors then we could be in a
position where yeah you know that the

1196
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,150
position where yeah you know that the
 

1197
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,940
position where yeah you know that the
browser that we showed the log we showed

1198
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:31,950
browser that we showed the log we showed
 

1199
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,530
browser that we showed the log we showed
the browser's contains the bogus

1200
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:33,540
the browser's contains the bogus
 

1201
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,770
the browser's contains the bogus
certificate but the log we showed a

1202
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:36,780
certificate but the log we showed a
 

1203
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,700
certificate but the log we showed a
monitors doesn't doesn't contain the

1204
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:39,710
monitors doesn't doesn't contain the
 

1205
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,990
monitors doesn't doesn't contain the
bogus certificate so we have to rule out

1206
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,000
bogus certificate so we have to rule out
 

1207
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,230
bogus certificate so we have to rule out
equivocation to all without trusting the

1208
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:45,240
equivocation to all without trusting the
 

1209
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,690
equivocation to all without trusting the
servers so how can we do this now we're

1210
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:50,700
servers so how can we do this now we're
 

1211
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,810
servers so how can we do this now we're
getting into the kind of details that

1212
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:53,820
getting into the kind of details that
 

1213
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,540
getting into the kind of details that
the last of the assignments was talking

1214
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:56,550
the last of the assignments was talking
 

1215
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:00,860
the last of the assignments was talking
about the first step is this thing

1216
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:00,870
about the first step is this thing
 

1217
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:05,840
about the first step is this thing
called a Merkel tree and this is

1218
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:05,850
called a Merkel tree and this is
 

1219
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,420
called a Merkel tree and this is
something that's sort of that the log

1220
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:08,430
something that's sort of that the log
 

1221
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,310
something that's sort of that the log
servers are expected to build on top of

1222
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,320
servers are expected to build on top of
 

1223
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,560
servers are expected to build on top of
the log so the idea is that there's the

1224
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:12,570
the log so the idea is that there's the
 

1225
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,740
the log so the idea is that there's the
actual log itself which is a sequence of

1226
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:14,750
actual log itself which is a sequence of
 

1227
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,260
actual log itself which is a sequence of
certificates you know certificate one

1228
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:17,270
certificates you know certificate one
 

1229
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,880
certificates you know certificate one
certificate to presumably in the order

1230
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:19,890
certificate to presumably in the order
 

1231
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:24,830
certificate to presumably in the order
that a certificate

1232
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:24,840
that a certificate
 

1233
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,570
that a certificate
certificates to be added to the system

1234
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:26,580
certificates to be added to the system
 

1235
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,399
certificates to be added to the system
and the prime millions I'm just going to

1236
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:28,409
and the prime millions I'm just going to
 

1237
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:33,470
and the prime millions I'm just going to
assume there's a couple now it's gonna

1238
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:33,480
assume there's a couple now it's gonna
 

1239
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,510
assume there's a couple now it's gonna
turn out you know we don't want to have

1240
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:35,520
turn out you know we don't want to have
 

1241
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,830
turn out you know we don't want to have
the browser's have to download the whole

1242
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:36,840
the browser's have to download the whole
 

1243
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,399
the browser's have to download the whole
log and so we need tools to so that we

1244
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:40,409
log and so we need tools to so that we
 

1245
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,320
log and so we need tools to so that we
can allow the logging system to

1246
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:42,330
can allow the logging system to
 

1247
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:48,529
can allow the logging system to
basically send trustworthy summaries or

1248
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:48,539
basically send trustworthy summaries or
 

1249
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,240
basically send trustworthy summaries or
unambiguous summaries of what's in the

1250
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,250
unambiguous summaries of what's in the
 

1251
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,240
unambiguous summaries of what's in the
log to the the browsers and I'll talk in

1252
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,250
log to the the browsers and I'll talk in
 

1253
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,649
log to the the browsers and I'll talk in
a bit about it exactly what those

1254
00:27:54,649 --> 00:27:54,659
a bit about it exactly what those
 

1255
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,110
a bit about it exactly what those
summaries are used for but the basic

1256
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,120
summaries are used for but the basic
 

1257
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,740
summaries are used for but the basic
scheme is that the log servers are gonna

1258
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:03,750
scheme is that the log servers are gonna
 

1259
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,549
scheme is that the log servers are gonna
use cryptographic hashes to sort of hash

1260
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:07,559
use cryptographic hashes to sort of hash
 

1261
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:10,399
use cryptographic hashes to sort of hash
up the complete set of records that are

1262
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:10,409
up the complete set of records that are
 

1263
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:11,870
up the complete set of records that are
in the log can produce a single

1264
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:11,880
in the log can produce a single
 

1265
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,539
in the log can produce a single
cryptographic hash which is typically

1266
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:14,549
cryptographic hash which is typically
 

1267
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:16,850
cryptographic hash which is typically
these days about 256 bits long so the

1268
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:16,860
these days about 256 bits long so the
 

1269
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,399
these days about 256 bits long so the
cryptographic hash summarizes the

1270
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:19,409
cryptographic hash summarizes the
 

1271
00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:23,029
cryptographic hash summarizes the
countenance of the log and the way

1272
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:23,039
countenance of the log and the way
 

1273
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,639
countenance of the log and the way
that's done is that the is as a

1274
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:25,649
that's done is that the is as a
 

1275
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:28,940
that's done is that the is as a
basically a tree structure of pairs over

1276
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:28,950
basically a tree structure of pairs over
 

1277
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,620
basically a tree structure of pairs over
hash always hashing together pairs of

1278
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:30,630
hash always hashing together pairs of
 

1279
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:35,930
hash always hashing together pairs of
numbers at the zeroeth level so I'm

1280
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:35,940
numbers at the zeroeth level so I'm
 

1281
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,720
numbers at the zeroeth level so I'm
gonna write each for a hash each one of

1282
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:38,730
gonna write each for a hash each one of
 

1283
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,310
gonna write each for a hash each one of
the log entries has a hash so we're

1284
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
the log entries has a hash so we're
 

1285
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,740
the log entries has a hash so we're
gonna have sort of at the base level we

1286
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:42,750
gonna have sort of at the base level we
 

1287
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:46,639
gonna have sort of at the base level we
have the hash of each log entry each

1288
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:46,649
have the hash of each log entry each
 

1289
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:50,029
have the hash of each log entry each
certificate and then we're going to hash

1290
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:50,039
certificate and then we're going to hash
 

1291
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:55,700
certificate and then we're going to hash
up peers so that the next level we're

1292
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:55,710
up peers so that the next level we're
 

1293
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,260
up peers so that the next level we're
gonna have a hash of this and

1294
00:28:59,260 --> 00:28:59,270
gonna have a hash of this and
 

1295
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:04,180
gonna have a hash of this and
concatenated with this and a hash of

1296
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,190
concatenated with this and a hash of
 

1297
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,789
concatenated with this and a hash of
this concatenated with this these two

1298
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:07,799
this concatenated with this these two
 

1299
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:12,320
this concatenated with this these two
hashes and then at the top level sort of

1300
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,330

 

1301
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,509

we're we're overdoing is hashing these

1302
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:14,519
we're we're overdoing is hashing these
 

1303
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,310
we're we're overdoing is hashing these
two the concatenation of these two

1304
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:16,320
two the concatenation of these two
 

1305
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,850
two the concatenation of these two
hashes and this single hash here is a

1306
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:21,860

 

1307
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:26,029

unambiguous sort of stand-in for the

1308
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:26,039
unambiguous sort of stand-in for the
 

1309
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,370
unambiguous sort of stand-in for the
complete log one of the properties of

1310
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:28,380
complete log one of the properties of
 

1311
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,009
complete log one of the properties of
these cryptographic hashes like sha-256

1312
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:31,019
these cryptographic hashes like sha-256
 

1313
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,560
these cryptographic hashes like sha-256
is that it's not feasible to find two

1314
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:33,570
is that it's not feasible to find two
 

1315
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,630
is that it's not feasible to find two
inputs to the hash function that produce

1316
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:35,640
inputs to the hash function that produce
 

1317
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,759
inputs to the hash function that produce
the same output and that means if you

1318
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:37,769
the same output and that means if you
 

1319
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:39,139
the same output and that means if you
tell somebody the output of the hash

1320
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:39,149
tell somebody the output of the hash
 

1321
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:43,279
tell somebody the output of the hash
function there's only one input you're

1322
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:43,289
function there's only one input you're
 

1323
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:44,830
function there's only one input you're
ever going to be able to find that

1324
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:44,840
ever going to be able to find that
 

1325
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,350
ever going to be able to find that
produce that output so if the log server

1326
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:48,360
produce that output so if the log server
 

1327
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,110
produce that output so if the log server
does hash up in this way the contents of

1328
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,120
does hash up in this way the contents of
 

1329
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,139
does hash up in this way the contents of
its logs only this sequence of these log

1330
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:54,149
its logs only this sequence of these log
 

1331
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:56,389
its logs only this sequence of these log
records will ever be able to produce

1332
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:56,399
records will ever be able to produce
 

1333
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,750
records will ever be able to produce
that hash or guaranteed effectively that

1334
00:29:59,750 --> 00:29:59,760
that hash or guaranteed effectively that
 

1335
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,450
that hash or guaranteed effectively that
the log server is not going to be able

1336
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:02,460
the log server is not going to be able
 

1337
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,389
the log server is not going to be able
to find some other log that produces the

1338
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:05,399
to find some other log that produces the
 

1339
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:09,169
to find some other log that produces the
same final tree hash as this sequence of

1340
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:09,179
same final tree hash as this sequence of
 

1341
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:12,590
same final tree hash as this sequence of
log entries all right so this is the

1342
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:12,600
log entries all right so this is the
 

1343
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,840
log entries all right so this is the
Merkel tree this is the sort of tree

1344
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:14,850
Merkel tree this is the sort of tree
 

1345
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,649
Merkel tree this is the sort of tree
hash that summarizes the entire log at

1346
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:18,659
hash that summarizes the entire log at
 

1347
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:23,180
hash that summarizes the entire log at
the top of the Merkel tree there there's

1348
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:23,190
the top of the Merkel tree there there's
 

1349
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:27,740
the top of the Merkel tree there there's
will actually call it a signed tree head

1350
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:27,750
will actually call it a signed tree head
 

1351
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,750
will actually call it a signed tree head
because in fact the log servers take

1352
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:29,760
because in fact the log servers take
 

1353
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,000
because in fact the log servers take
this hash this at the top of the tree

1354
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,010
this hash this at the top of the tree
 

1355
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,680
this hash this at the top of the tree
and sign it with their private key and

1356
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:33,690
and sign it with their private key and
 

1357
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,980
and sign it with their private key and
give that to clients to browsers and

1358
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:36,990
give that to clients to browsers and
 

1359
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:40,759
give that to clients to browsers and
monitors and the fact that they've

1360
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:40,769
monitors and the fact that they've
 

1361
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:42,259
monitors and the fact that they've
signed it means that they they can't

1362
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:42,269
signed it means that they they can't
 

1363
00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:43,460
signed it means that they they can't
disavow it later

1364
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:43,470
disavow it later
 

1365
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,560
disavow it later
that was really them and produced it so

1366
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:45,570
that was really them and produced it so
 

1367
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,120
that was really them and produced it so
that's you know just to be able to catch

1368
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,130
that's you know just to be able to catch
 

1369
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:53,330
that's you know just to be able to catch
lying lying log servers and so the point

1370
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:53,340
lying lying log servers and so the point
 

1371
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,879
lying lying log servers and so the point
here is that once a log server has

1372
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:55,889
here is that once a log server has
 

1373
00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:59,840
here is that once a log server has
revealed a particular sign tree head to

1374
00:30:59,840 --> 00:30:59,850
revealed a particular sign tree head to
 

1375
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:03,259
revealed a particular sign tree head to
a browser or monitor its committed to

1376
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:03,269
a browser or monitor its committed to
 

1377
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:05,659
a browser or monitor its committed to
some specific log contents because it

1378
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:05,669
some specific log contents because it
 

1379
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:06,710
some specific log contents because it
won't be able to ever produce a

1380
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:06,720
won't be able to ever produce a
 

1381
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
won't be able to ever produce a
different log contents to produce the

1382
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:08,730
different log contents to produce the
 

1383
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,340
different log contents to produce the
same hash so you hashes are really

1384
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:10,350
same hash so you hashes are really
 

1385
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:14,690
same hash so you hashes are really
function as kind of commitments okay so

1386
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:14,700
function as kind of commitments okay so
 

1387
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,480
function as kind of commitments okay so
this is the with the log but the Merkel

1388
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:17,490
this is the with the log but the Merkel
 

1389
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:20,360
this is the with the log but the Merkel
tree looks like for a particular log now

1390
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:20,370
tree looks like for a particular log now
 

1391
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:23,419
tree looks like for a particular log now
the third reading today sort of outlined

1392
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:23,429
the third reading today sort of outlined
 

1393
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:25,100
the third reading today sort of outlined
how to

1394
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,110
how to
 

1395
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,200
how to
and the law how to add records to the

1396
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,210
and the law how to add records to the
 

1397
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:32,780
and the law how to add records to the
log for arbitrary numbers of Records I'm

1398
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:32,790
log for arbitrary numbers of Records I'm
 

1399
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,370
log for arbitrary numbers of Records I'm
just going to assume that the log always

1400
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:34,380
just going to assume that the log always
 

1401
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,340
just going to assume that the log always
grows by factors of 2 which is

1402
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:37,350
grows by factors of 2 which is
 

1403
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,080
grows by factors of 2 which is
impractical but makes it easier to

1404
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,090
impractical but makes it easier to
 

1405
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,180
impractical but makes it easier to
explain Naumann so that means that as

1406
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:41,190
explain Naumann so that means that as
 

1407
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,220
explain Naumann so that means that as
certificate authorities send in new

1408
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,230
certificate authorities send in new
 

1409
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,289
certificate authorities send in new
certificates to add to the log the log

1410
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:45,299
certificates to add to the log the log
 

1411
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:48,770
certificates to add to the log the log
server will wait until it has as many

1412
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:48,780
server will wait until it has as many
 

1413
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,810
server will wait until it has as many
new records as it has old records and

1414
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:50,820
new records as it has old records and
 

1415
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,169
new records as it has old records and
then produce another tree head and the

1416
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:54,179
then produce another tree head and the
 

1417
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,750
then produce another tree head and the
way it does that is it's gonna in order

1418
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:56,760
way it does that is it's gonna in order
 

1419
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,100
way it does that is it's gonna in order
to extend the log the log servers going

1420
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,110
to extend the log the log servers going
 

1421
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,780
to extend the log the log servers going
to wait off as another four records and

1422
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:02,790
to wait off as another four records and
 

1423
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,659
to wait off as another four records and
then it's gonna hash them pairwise just

1424
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:05,669
then it's gonna hash them pairwise just
 

1425
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:10,480
then it's gonna hash them pairwise just
as before and then it'll produce a new

1426
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:10,490

 

1427
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,240

tree head that is the hash of the

1428
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,250
tree head that is the hash of the
 

1429
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:21,370
tree head that is the hash of the
concatenation of these two hashes and

1430
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:21,380

 

1431
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:26,360

this is the new tree head for the new

1432
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:26,370
this is the new tree head for the new
 

1433
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,940
this is the new tree head for the new
expanded law and so that means as time

1434
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:28,950
expanded law and so that means as time
 

1435
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:32,990
expanded law and so that means as time
goes on and a log server this log grows

1436
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,000
goes on and a log server this log grows
 

1437
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,760
goes on and a log server this log grows
longer and longer it produces sort of

1438
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:34,770
longer and longer it produces sort of
 

1439
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,669
longer and longer it produces sort of
higher and higher a sequence of higher

1440
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:37,679
higher and higher a sequence of higher
 

1441
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:44,799
higher and higher a sequence of higher
and higher tree heads as the logarithms

1442
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:44,809

 

1443
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:50,390

okay so this is the structure that we're

1444
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:50,400
okay so this is the structure that we're
 

1445
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,690
okay so this is the structure that we're
expecting log servers to maintain of

1446
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:53,700
expecting log servers to maintain of
 

1447
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,530
expecting log servers to maintain of
course who knows what they're actually

1448
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:54,540
course who knows what they're actually
 

1449
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,990
course who knows what they're actually
doing especially if they're malicious

1450
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:57,000
doing especially if they're malicious
 

1451
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,780
doing especially if they're malicious
but the protocol the certificate

1452
00:32:59,780 --> 00:32:59,790
but the protocol the certificate
 

1453
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,789
but the protocol the certificate
transparency protocol sort of is written

1454
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:01,799
transparency protocol sort of is written
 

1455
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,830
transparency protocol sort of is written
you know as if the log server was was

1456
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:03,840
you know as if the log server was was
 

1457
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,080
you know as if the log server was was
actually doing this all right so what do

1458
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,090
actually doing this all right so what do
 

1459
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,630
actually doing this all right so what do
we need to do but do the point of this

1460
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:08,640
we need to do but do the point of this
 

1461
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,299
we need to do but do the point of this
Merkle trees is to use them to force log

1462
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:14,309
Merkle trees is to use them to force log
 

1463
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:16,400
Merkle trees is to use them to force log
servers to prove certain things about

1464
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:16,410
servers to prove certain things about
 

1465
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,830
servers to prove certain things about
the logs that they can about the log

1466
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:18,840
the logs that they can about the log
 

1467
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,049
the logs that they can about the log
that they're maintaining we're going to

1468
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:21,059
that they're maintaining we're going to
 

1469
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:24,049
that they're maintaining we're going to
want to know what those those proofs

1470
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:24,059
want to know what those those proofs
 

1471
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:27,210
want to know what those those proofs
look like the first kind of

1472
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:27,220
look like the first kind of
 

1473
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:33,500
look like the first kind of
is what I'll call a proof of inclusion

1474
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:33,510
is what I'll call a proof of inclusion
 

1475
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:40,040
is what I'll call a proof of inclusion
and this is what a

1476
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,050

 

1477
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,530

NEADS when it when it wants to find out

1478
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:42,540
NEADS when it when it wants to find out
 

1479
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,870
NEADS when it when it wants to find out
if a certificate that has just been

1480
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:44,880
if a certificate that has just been
 

1481
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,310
if a certificate that has just been
given by a web server if that

1482
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,320
given by a web server if that
 

1483
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,280
given by a web server if that
certificate is really in the law it's

1484
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:49,290
certificate is really in the law it's
 

1485
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:54,170
certificate is really in the law it's
gonna ask the certificate it's gonna ask

1486
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:54,180
gonna ask the certificate it's gonna ask
 

1487
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,080
gonna ask the certificate it's gonna ask
the log server look here's a certificate

1488
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,090
the log server look here's a certificate
 

1489
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:59,540
the log server look here's a certificate
you know is it an is it in your log and

1490
00:33:59,540 --> 00:33:59,550
you know is it an is it in your log and
 

1491
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,100
you know is it an is it in your log and
the certificate server is gonna send

1492
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,110
the certificate server is gonna send
 

1493
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:05,600
the certificate server is gonna send
back a proof of actually not just that

1494
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:05,610
back a proof of actually not just that
 

1495
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,070
back a proof of actually not just that
the certificate is in the log but

1496
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,080
the certificate is in the log but
 

1497
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,510
the certificate is in the log but
actually where it is what its position

1498
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:08,520
actually where it is what its position
 

1499
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:14,750
actually where it is what its position
is in the log and of course the browser

1500
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:14,760
is in the log and of course the browser
 

1501
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,100
is in the log and of course the browser
wants this proof because it doesn't want

1502
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,110
wants this proof because it doesn't want
 

1503
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,690
wants this proof because it doesn't want
to use the certificate if it's not in

1504
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:17,700
to use the certificate if it's not in
 

1505
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,580
to use the certificate if it's not in
the log because if it's not I'm along

1506
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:19,590
the log because if it's not I'm along
 

1507
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,050
the log because if it's not I'm along
then monitors won't see it and there's

1508
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,060
then monitors won't see it and there's
 

1509
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,270
then monitors won't see it and there's
no / - no protection against their

1510
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:23,280
no / - no protection against their
 

1511
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,260
no / - no protection against their
certificate being bogus and it needs to

1512
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:27,270
certificate being bogus and it needs to
 

1513
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:33,290
certificate being bogus and it needs to
be a proof because we we can't afford to

1514
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:33,300
be a proof because we we can't afford to
 

1515
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,360
be a proof because we we can't afford to
let this log server a malicious log

1516
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:35,370
let this log server a malicious log
 

1517
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,640
let this log server a malicious log
forever change its mind we don't want to

1518
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:37,650
forever change its mind we don't want to
 

1519
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,230
forever change its mind we don't want to
take the log servers word for it because

1520
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:39,240
take the log servers word for it because
 

1521
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,820
take the log servers word for it because
then they might a malicious log server

1522
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:40,830
then they might a malicious log server
 

1523
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,300
then they might a malicious log server
might say yes and this proof is gonna

1524
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:44,310
might say yes and this proof is gonna
 

1525
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,820
might say yes and this proof is gonna
help us catch it you know if a log

1526
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:46,830
help us catch it you know if a log
 

1527
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,070
help us catch it you know if a log
server does lie these proofs are gonna

1528
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:49,080
server does lie these proofs are gonna
 

1529
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,930
server does lie these proofs are gonna
help us catch the fact that the log

1530
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:50,940
help us catch the fact that the log
 

1531
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,320
help us catch the fact that the log
servers lied and produce evidence that

1532
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,330
servers lied and produce evidence that
 

1533
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,240
servers lied and produce evidence that
the log server is malicious and should

1534
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:56,250
the log server is malicious and should
 

1535
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,930
the log server is malicious and should
be ignored from now on is that sort of

1536
00:34:59,930 --> 00:34:59,940
be ignored from now on is that sort of
 

1537
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,490
be ignored from now on is that sort of
the ultimate sanction against the log

1538
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:01,500
the ultimate sanction against the log
 

1539
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,830
the ultimate sanction against the log
servers is that the browser's actually

1540
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:03,840
servers is that the browser's actually
 

1541
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,510
servers is that the browser's actually
have a list of acceptable log servers

1542
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:05,520
have a list of acceptable log servers
 

1543
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,100
have a list of acceptable log servers
and these proofs would be part of the

1544
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,110
and these proofs would be part of the
 

1545
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:14,360
and these proofs would be part of the
evidence to cause one of the log servers

1546
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:14,370
evidence to cause one of the log servers
 

1547
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,220
evidence to cause one of the log servers
to be taken out of the log if it was

1548
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:16,230
to be taken out of the log if it was
 

1549
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,650
to be taken out of the log if it was
malicious okay so we need a proof we

1550
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:18,660
malicious okay so we need a proof we
 

1551
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,150
malicious okay so we need a proof we
want the log server to produce a proof

1552
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,160
want the log server to produce a proof
 

1553
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,370
want the log server to produce a proof
that a given certificate is in its log

1554
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:24,380
that a given certificate is in its log
 

1555
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,180
that a given certificate is in its log
so actually the first step is that the

1556
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:29,190
so actually the first step is that the
 

1557
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,760
so actually the first step is that the
browser asks the log server for the

1558
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:31,770
browser asks the log server for the
 

1559
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:35,660
browser asks the log server for the
current sign tree head so what the

1560
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:35,670
current sign tree head so what the
 

1561
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,730
current sign tree head so what the
browser's really asking is is this

1562
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:37,740
browser's really asking is is this
 

1563
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,030
browser's really asking is is this
certificate in the log that summarized

1564
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,040
certificate in the log that summarized
 

1565
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,110
certificate in the log that summarized
by this current by this sign tree head

1566
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:45,120
by this current by this sign tree head
 

1567
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,330
by this current by this sign tree head
and the log server may lie about the

1568
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:47,340
and the log server may lie about the
 

1569
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,850
and the log server may lie about the
sign tree head right the browser asks it

1570
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:49,860
sign tree head right the browser asks it
 

1571
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,210
sign tree head right the browser asks it
for the current sign tree head and then

1572
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:52,220
for the current sign tree head and then
 

1573
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,400
for the current sign tree head and then
for a proof that the certificate is in

1574
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,410
for a proof that the certificate is in
 

1575
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,950
for a proof that the certificate is in
the log the log server could lie about

1576
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:56,960
the log the log server could lie about
 

1577
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,300
the log the log server could lie about
the sign tree headband will deal about

1578
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:58,310
the sign tree headband will deal about
 

1579
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,150
the sign tree headband will deal about
that we'll consider that later but for

1580
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,160
that we'll consider that later but for
 

1581
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,310
that we'll consider that later but for
now let's assume that the the browser

1582
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:06,320
now let's assume that the the browser
 

1583
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,609
now let's assume that the the browser
has the correct sign tree head and is

1584
00:36:09,609 --> 00:36:09,619
has the correct sign tree head and is
 

1585
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:12,790
has the correct sign tree head and is
demanding a proof okay so for simplicity

1586
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:12,800
demanding a proof okay so for simplicity
 

1587
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,040
demanding a proof okay so for simplicity
I'm just gonna explain how to do this

1588
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,050
I'm just gonna explain how to do this
 

1589
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,630
I'm just gonna explain how to do this
for a log with two records and it turns

1590
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:16,640
for a log with two records and it turns
 

1591
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,970
for a log with two records and it turns
out that extending that to a log with

1592
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:18,980
out that extending that to a log with
 

1593
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,849
out that extending that to a log with
with other more higher power of two

1594
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:21,859
with other more higher power of two
 

1595
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:26,320
with other more higher power of two
records is relatively easy um so the

1596
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:26,330
records is relatively easy um so the
 

1597
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,970
records is relatively easy um so the
browser actually has a particular sign

1598
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:27,980
browser actually has a particular sign
 

1599
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:32,800
browser actually has a particular sign
tree head let's suppose the correct log

1600
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:32,810
tree head let's suppose the correct log
 

1601
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:35,440
tree head let's suppose the correct log
that sits under that sign tree head is

1602
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:35,450
that sits under that sign tree head is
 

1603
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:39,880
that sits under that sign tree head is
the two LM in log a B for particular

1604
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:39,890
the two LM in log a B for particular
 

1605
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:44,040
the two LM in log a B for particular
certificates a and B and that means that

1606
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,050
certificates a and B and that means that
 

1607
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,270
certificates a and B and that means that
the correct

1608
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:46,280
the correct
 

1609
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,540
the correct
Merkle tree for that it securely is at

1610
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:49,550
Merkle tree for that it securely is at
 

1611
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,839
Merkle tree for that it securely is at
the bottom as the hashes of a and B and

1612
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:52,849
the bottom as the hashes of a and B and
 

1613
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:56,620
the bottom as the hashes of a and B and
then the sign tree head is actually the

1614
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:56,630
then the sign tree head is actually the
 

1615
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:01,210
then the sign tree head is actually the
hash of a hash of a concatenated with a

1616
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:01,220
hash of a hash of a concatenated with a
 

1617
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:06,670
hash of a hash of a concatenated with a
hash would be so let's suppose this is

1618
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:06,680
hash would be so let's suppose this is
 

1619
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,849
hash would be so let's suppose this is
the sign tree head that the certificate

1620
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:09,859
the sign tree head that the certificate
 

1621
00:37:09,859 --> 00:37:11,950
the sign tree head that the certificate
that the log server actually gave to the

1622
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:11,960
that the log server actually gave to the
 

1623
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,599
that the log server actually gave to the
client of course the client doesn't this

1624
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:16,609
client of course the client doesn't this
 

1625
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:20,050
client of course the client doesn't this
client only knows this value this is

1626
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,060
client only knows this value this is
 

1627
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,400
client only knows this value this is
final hash value doesn't actually know

1628
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:21,410
final hash value doesn't actually know
 

1629
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:26,800
final hash value doesn't actually know
what is in the log the proof if the if

1630
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:26,810
what is in the log the proof if the if
 

1631
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,450
what is in the log the proof if the if
the browser asked for a proof that a is

1632
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:28,460
the browser asked for a proof that a is
 

1633
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:33,730
the browser asked for a proof that a is
in the log then the proof that the log

1634
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:33,740
in the log then the proof that the log
 

1635
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:38,050
in the log then the proof that the log
server can return is simply the proof

1636
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:38,060
server can return is simply the proof
 

1637
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:42,700
server can return is simply the proof
for a is a in the log is simply eizan in

1638
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:42,710
for a is a in the log is simply eizan in
 

1639
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:50,940
for a is a in the log is simply eizan in
the log and the hash of the other

1640
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:50,950
the log and the hash of the other
 

1641
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:55,270
the log and the hash of the other
element in the log so zero and the hash

1642
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:55,280
element in the log so zero and the hash
 

1643
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,930

00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:00,900
and that is enough information for a to
 

1647
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,319

convince itself that for sorry for the
 

1649
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:05,750
convince itself that for sorry for the
client to convince itself that a really

00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:05,760
client to convince itself that a really
 

1651
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,059
client to convince itself that a really

is at position zero because it can take
 

1653
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:10,280
is at position zero because it can take
it knows the certificate is interested

1654
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:10,290
it knows the certificate is interested
 

1655
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:13,819
it knows the certificate is interested
in it can hash it part of the proof was

in it can hash it part of the proof was
the hash of the other element in this

1658
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:16,619
the hash of the other element in this
 

1659
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:21,020
the hash of the other element in this
lowest level hash so the browser can

1660
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:21,030
lowest level hash so the browser can
 

1661
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,089
lowest level hash so the browser can
that now knows H a and H B you can hash

1662
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:23,099
that now knows H a and H B you can hash
 

1663
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:26,089
that now knows H a and H B you can hash
them together can execute this hash and

1664
00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:26,099
them together can execute this hash and
 

1665
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:27,740
them together can execute this hash and
see if the result is the same as the

00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:27,750
see if the result is the same as the
 

1667
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,750
see if the result is the same as the
sine tree head that it happens and if it

00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:29,760
sine tree head that it happens and if it
 

1669
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,280
sine tree head that it happens and if it
is then that means that the certificate

1670
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:34,290
is then that means that the certificate
 

1671
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,690
is then that means that the certificate
log is actually produce a valid proof

log is actually produce a valid proof
 

1673
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,970
log is actually produce a valid proof
that certificate a is at position B

1674
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:39,980
that certificate a is at position B
 

1675
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,650
that certificate a is at position B
that's a sorry it's a position zero in

larger logs you know if you're looking
 

1683
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,319
larger logs you know if you're looking
for if you need a proof that a is really

00:38:57,329 --> 00:38:59,599
for if you need a proof that a is really
here all you need is the sequence of

1686
00:38:59,599 --> 00:38:59,609
here all you need is the sequence of
 

1687
00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:05,270
here all you need is the sequence of
hashes of the other branch of each hash

1688
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:05,280
hashes of the other branch of each hash
 

1689
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,870
hashes of the other branch of each hash
up to the sign tree head that you have

00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:07,880
up to the sign tree head that you have
 

1691
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,210
up to the sign tree head that you have
so in a for element log if you if you

1692
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:11,220
so in a for element log if you if you
 

1693
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,280
so in a for element log if you if you
need a proof that a is position zero you

1694
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,290
need a proof that a is position zero you
 

1695
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,650
need a proof that a is position zero you
need this hash units then you need this

1696
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:15,660
need this hash units then you need this
 

1697
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,630
need this hash units then you need this
hash and if the lock is bigger you know

1698
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:17,640
hash and if the lock is bigger you know
 

1699
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,550
hash and if the lock is bigger you know
eight elements then you also need this

1700
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:19,560
eight elements then you also need this
 

1701
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,099
eight elements then you also need this
hash assuming that you have the signed

1702
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:22,109
hash assuming that you have the signed
 

1703
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,540
hash assuming that you have the signed
tree hit so you can take the element you

1704
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:23,550
tree hit so you can take the element you
 

1705
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,700
tree hit so you can take the element you
know and hash it together with each of

1706
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:25,710
know and hash it together with each of
 

1707
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:28,160
know and hash it together with each of
these other hashes see if it's equal to

1708
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,170
these other hashes see if it's equal to
 

1709
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:32,750
these other hashes see if it's equal to
the sign tree head okay so if the

1710
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:32,760
the sign tree head okay so if the
 

1711
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,550
the sign tree head okay so if the
browser asks is supposing the browser

1712
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:34,560
browser asks is supposing the browser
 

1713
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,760
browser asks is supposing the browser
asks whether X is in the log at position

1714
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:37,770
asks whether X is in the log at position
 

1715
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:41,710
asks whether X is in the log at position
zero well X isn't in the log right so

1716
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:41,720
zero well X isn't in the log right so
 

1717
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,420
zero well X isn't in the log right so
hopefully there's no easy way for the

1718
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:44,430
hopefully there's no easy way for the
 

1719
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,130
hopefully there's no easy way for the
log server to produce the proof that X

1720
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:46,140
log server to produce the proof that X
 

1721
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,920
log server to produce the proof that X
is in the log in position zero but

1722
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:48,930
is in the log in position zero but
 

1723
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,660
is in the log in position zero but
suppose the log servers wants to lie and

1724
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:50,670
suppose the log servers wants to lie and
 

1725
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,550
suppose the log servers wants to lie and
it's in the position where it already

00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:52,560
it's in the position where it already
 

1727
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,490
it's in the position where it already
exposed a sign tree head for log that

1728
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:55,500
exposed a sign tree head for log that
 

1729
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,300
exposed a sign tree head for log that
contain a and then B browser doesn't

1730
00:39:59,300 --> 00:39:59,310
contain a and then B browser doesn't
 

1731
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,099
contain a and then B browser doesn't
know was a and B doesn't know what's in

00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:01,109
know was a and B doesn't know what's in
 

1733
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:03,829
know was a and B doesn't know what's in
the log and the log server wants to

00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:03,839
the log and the log server wants to
 

1735
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,470
the log and the log server wants to
trick the client into the browser into

1736
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:06,480
trick the client into the browser into
 

1737
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,970
trick the client into the browser into
thinking that it's really

00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:17,450
at position zero well it turns out that
in order to do that the for this small

00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:17,460
in order to do that the for this small
 

1743
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,290
in order to do that the for this small

concatenated with X you know so this is
 

1751
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,900
concatenated with X you know so this is
that's that it's equal to the sign tree

00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:41,910
that's that it's equal to the sign tree
 

1753
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:44,090
that's that it's equal to the sign tree
head right because the client we're

produces that same sign tree hit well we

1764
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:55,710
produces that same sign tree hit well we
 

1765
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,080
produces that same sign tree hit well we
know the sign tree head or the

1766
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,090
know the sign tree head or the
 

1767
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,250
know the sign tree head or the
assumption is assigned tree it was

assumption is assigned tree it was
 

1769
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,570
assumption is assigned tree it was
actually for some other log right

actually for some other log right
 

1771
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,740
actually for some other log right
because we're trying to rule out the

00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:00,750
because we're trying to rule out the
 

1773
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,580
because we're trying to rule out the
possibility that the log server can give

1774
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:04,590
possibility that the log server can give
 

1775
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,530
possibility that the log server can give
you a sign tree head for one log but

1776
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:06,540
you a sign tree head for one log but
 

1777
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,050
you a sign tree head for one log but
that convince you that something else is

1778
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:09,060
that convince you that something else is
 

1779
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,790
that convince you that something else is
in that log that's not there so the sign

1780
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:10,800
in that log that's not there so the sign
 

1781
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,960
in that log that's not there so the sign
tree had really was produced by from the

1782
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:14,970
tree had really was produced by from the
 

1783
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:17,900
tree had really was produced by from the
hashes of the records that really were

1784
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:17,910
hashes of the records that really were
 

1785
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:22,910
hashes of the records that really were
in the log and now we need and since you

1786
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:22,920
in the log and now we need and since you
 

1787
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,860
in the log and now we need and since you
know X is definitely different from a

1788
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:24,870
know X is definitely different from a
 

1789
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,480
know X is definitely different from a
that means the hash of X is different

1790
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:26,490
that means the hash of X is different
 

1791
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:28,550
that means the hash of X is different
from the hash of a and that means that

1792
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:28,560
from the hash of a and that means that
 

1793
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,540
from the hash of a and that means that
the log server needs to find two

1794
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:32,550
the log server needs to find two
 

1795
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:35,540
the log server needs to find two
different inputs to the hash function

1796
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:35,550
different inputs to the hash function
 

1797
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:38,780
different inputs to the hash function
that produced the same output and the

1798
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:38,790
that produced the same output and the
 

1799
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,540
that produced the same output and the
Assumption widely believed to be true

1800
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:41,550
Assumption widely believed to be true
 

1801
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,340
Assumption widely believed to be true
for practical purposes is that that's

1802
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:43,350
for practical purposes is that that's
 

1803
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:46,030
for practical purposes is that that's
not possible for cryptographic hashes

1804
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:46,040
not possible for cryptographic hashes
 

1805
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,300
not possible for cryptographic hashes
therefore the cent sign tree head was

1806
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:50,310
therefore the cent sign tree head was
 

1807
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:53,660
therefore the cent sign tree head was
produced by hashing up one log that it

1808
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:53,670
produced by hashing up one log that it
 

1809
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:56,240
produced by hashing up one log that it
will not be possible to find these sort

1810
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:56,250
will not be possible to find these sort
 

1811
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:00,050
will not be possible to find these sort
of other hash values that would be

1812
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:00,060
of other hash values that would be
 

1813
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,190
of other hash values that would be
required to produce a proof that some

1814
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:04,200
required to produce a proof that some
 

1815
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,200
required to produce a proof that some
other element was in the log that wasn't

1816
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,210
other element was in the log that wasn't
 

1817
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,960
other element was in the log that wasn't
really there

1818
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:07,970
really there
 

1819
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:17,080
really there
any questions about this about anything

1820
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,090

interesting a nice thing about this is

1824
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:20,700
interesting a nice thing about this is
 

1825
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,230
interesting a nice thing about this is
that the proofs are the proofs consist

1826
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:24,240
that the proofs are the proofs consist
 

1827
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,530
that the proofs are the proofs consist
of just the sort of other hashes on the

1828
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:27,540
of just the sort of other hashes on the
 

1829
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,960
of just the sort of other hashes on the
way up to the root if there's n

1830
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:29,970
way up to the root if there's n
 

1831
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:32,180
way up to the root if there's n
certificates there's only log in other

1832
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:32,190
certificates there's only log in other
 

1833
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,820
certificates there's only log in other
hashes and so the proofs are reasonably

1834
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:34,830
hashes and so the proofs are reasonably
 

1835
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:36,560
hashes and so the proofs are reasonably
concise in particular that are much much

1836
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:36,570
concise in particular that are much much
 

1837
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:39,109
concise in particular that are much much
smaller than the full log and since you

1838
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:39,119
smaller than the full log and since you
 

1839
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,580
smaller than the full log and since you
know every browser that needs to connect

1840
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:40,590
know every browser that needs to connect
 

1841
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,950
know every browser that needs to connect
to a website he's going to need one of

1842
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:42,960
to a website he's going to need one of
 

1843
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,100
to a website he's going to need one of
these proofs it's good if they're small

1844
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,110

 

1845
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:51,530

okay well this was whole discussion was

1846
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:51,540
okay well this was whole discussion was
 

1847
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:55,190
okay well this was whole discussion was
assuming that the sign tree had the

1848
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:55,200
assuming that the sign tree had the
 

1849
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,089
assuming that the sign tree had the
theum

1850
00:42:58,089 --> 00:42:58,099

 

1851
00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:04,479

or had was the correct sign tree head if

1852
00:43:04,479 --> 00:43:04,489
or had was the correct sign tree head if
 

1853
00:43:04,489 --> 00:43:07,870
or had was the correct sign tree head if
the but no there's no immediate reason

1854
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:07,880
the but no there's no immediate reason
 

1855
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,819
the but no there's no immediate reason
to believe that the log server would

1856
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:09,829
to believe that the log server would
 

1857
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:11,680
to believe that the log server would
have given if the logs are is malicious

1858
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:11,690
have given if the logs are is malicious
 

1859
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,599
have given if the logs are is malicious
and it wants to trick a client you know

1860
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:13,609
and it wants to trick a client you know
 

1861
00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:14,890
and it wants to trick a client you know
why would it give the client the correct

1862
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:14,900
why would it give the client the correct
 

1863
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,599
why would it give the client the correct
see sign tree head why doesn't it give

1864
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:16,609
see sign tree head why doesn't it give
 

1865
00:43:16,609 --> 00:43:18,519
see sign tree head why doesn't it give
it just me giving the sign tree head for

1866
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:18,529
it just me giving the sign tree head for
 

1867
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,920
it just me giving the sign tree head for
the bogus log that it wants to trick the

1868
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:20,930
the bogus log that it wants to trick the
 

1869
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:24,309
the bogus log that it wants to trick the
client into using so we have to be

1870
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:24,319
client into using so we have to be
 

1871
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,079
client into using so we have to be
prepared for the possibility that the

1872
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,089
prepared for the possibility that the
 

1873
00:43:26,089 --> 00:43:28,539
prepared for the possibility that the
log server has cooked up I just

1874
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:28,549
log server has cooked up I just
 

1875
00:43:28,549 --> 00:43:29,890
log server has cooked up I just
completely different log for the browser

1876
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:29,900
completely different log for the browser
 

1877
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,660
completely different log for the browser
that's not like anybody else's log and

1878
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:31,670
that's not like anybody else's log and
 

1879
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,519
that's not like anybody else's log and
it just contains the bogus certificates

1880
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:33,529
it just contains the bogus certificates
 

1881
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:36,670
it just contains the bogus certificates
that a malicious log server wants to

1882
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:36,680
that a malicious log server wants to
 

1883
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:43,299
that a malicious log server wants to
trick this client into believing so what

1884
00:43:43,299 --> 00:43:43,309
trick this client into believing so what
 

1885
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:47,920
trick this client into believing so what
do we do about that well it turns out

1886
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:47,930
do we do about that well it turns out
 

1887
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:50,710
do we do about that well it turns out
that this is at least in the first

1888
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:50,720
that this is at least in the first
 

1889
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,739
that this is at least in the first
instance this is totally possible

1890
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:52,749
instance this is totally possible
 

1891
00:43:52,749 --> 00:43:55,809
instance this is totally possible
you know usually what's gonna happen

1892
00:43:55,809 --> 00:43:55,819
you know usually what's gonna happen
 

1893
00:43:55,819 --> 00:43:57,279
you know usually what's gonna happen
usually the way this will play out is

1894
00:43:57,279 --> 00:43:57,289
usually the way this will play out is
 

1895
00:43:57,289 --> 00:44:00,279
usually the way this will play out is
that we'd have some browser that was you

1896
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:00,289
that we'd have some browser that was you
 

1897
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:03,370
that we'd have some browser that was you
know seeing the correct logs until some

1898
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:03,380
know seeing the correct logs until some
 

1899
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,309
know seeing the correct logs until some

a fork attack is that if we just never

1939
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:05,910
bogus certificate B but we don't want to
show B to anybody else certainly not to

up this other log the sort of continues

00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:10,300
up this other log the sort of continues

00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,210
up this other log the sort of continues
as usual and contains new submissions

00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:18,550
certificate B and you know what this
 

1951
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,460
certificate B and you know what this
looks like is a fork because both the

sort of main log that monitors are shown

1954
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:23,680
sort of main log that monitors are shown
 

1955
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,370
sort of main log that monitors are shown
is kind of off on one fork and then this

1956
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:26,380
is kind of off on one fork and then this
 

1957
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,620
is kind of off on one fork and then this
vlog we're cooking up especially to

00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:28,630
vlog we're cooking up especially to
 

1959
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:31,470
vlog we're cooking up especially to
trick a victim is a different fork this

1960
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:31,480
trick a victim is a different fork this
 

1961
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,450
trick a victim is a different fork this
is the construction that the malicious

1962
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:33,460
is the construction that the malicious
 

1963
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,040
is the construction that the malicious
log server would have to produce if it

1964
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,050
log server would have to produce if it

00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:37,580

wants to trick a browser into using a
 

1967
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:42,390
wants to trick a browser into using a
bogus certificate and again these are

1968
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:42,400
bogus certificate and again these are
 

1969
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,780
bogus certificate and again these are
possible it's possible to do this at

1970
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:45,790
possible it's possible to do this at
 

1971
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:48,750
possible it's possible to do this at
least briefly in with certificate

1972
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:48,760
least briefly in with certificate
 

1973
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,250
least briefly in with certificate

luckily though is not the end of the

1976
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:54,820
luckily though is not the end of the
 

1977
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,540
luckily though is not the end of the
story and certificate authority contains

1978
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:57,550
story and certificate authority contains
 

1979
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:01,170
story and certificate authority contains
some tools that allow it to make Forks

1980
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:01,180
some tools that allow it to make Forks
 

1981
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:06,830
some tools that allow it to make Forks
much more difficult so the basic scheme

1982
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:06,840
much more difficult so the basic scheme
 

1983
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:15,030
much more difficult so the basic scheme
is that this isn't this is the way the

1984
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:15,040
is that this isn't this is the way the
 

1985
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,380
is that this isn't this is the way the
certificate authority sort of intended

certificate authority sort of intended
 

1987
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:18,000
certificate authority sort of intended
to work all certificate transparency is

to work all certificate transparency is
 

1989
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:20,930
to work all certificate transparency is
intended to work but doesn't quite

what's going on here is that the the the

what's going on here is that the the the
 

1993

00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:30,460
attacked or gonna see a a sign tree
 

1997
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,460
attacked or gonna see a a sign tree
particular sign tree head let's say

00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:32,470
particular sign tree head let's say
 

1999
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:33,690

science we hit one of course is gonna
 

2001
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:37,230
science we hit one of course is gonna
change as the log extends and the victim

2002
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:37,240
change as the log extends and the victim
 

2003
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,330
change as the log extends and the victim
we know must see some other sign tree

2004
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:39,340
we know must see some other sign tree
 

2005
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,340
we know must see some other sign tree
head because this is a signed tree hit

2006

forked the thing that makes this hard is
 

2085
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,170
forked the thing that makes this hard is
that even if a log hasn't been forked as

sign tree heads H 1 and H 2 and we're
 

2147
00:50:12,299 --> 00:50:22,609
sign tree heads H 1 and H 2 and we're
asking is h 1s log prefix really it's

2148
00:50:22,609 --> 00:50:22,619
asking is h 1s log prefix really it's
 

2149
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:24,649
asking is h 1s log prefix really it's
not these are - these are hashes so it's

2150
00:50:24,649 --> 00:50:24,659
not these are - these are hashes so it's
 

2151
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:26,659
not these are - these are hashes so it's
really asking about the log that the

2152
00:50:26,659 --> 00:50:26,669
really asking about the log that the
 

2153
00:50:26,669 --> 00:50:38,479
really asking about the log that the
hashes represent and you know we're

2154
00:50:38,479 --> 00:50:38,489
hashes represent and you know we're
 

2155
00:50:38,489 --> 00:50:40,370
hashes represent and you know we're
hoping the answer is yes and if the

2156
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:40,380
hoping the answer is yes and if the
 

2157
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,779
hoping the answer is yes and if the
answer's no that means that the log

2158
00:50:41,779 --> 00:50:41,789
answer's no that means that the log
 

2159
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,639

00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:51,059
from one party or the other okay well it
 

2163
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:54,079
from one party or the other okay well it
turns out that um as we as I mentioned

2164
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,089
turns out that um as we as I mentioned
 

2165
00:50:54,089 --> 00:50:57,259
turns out that um as we as I mentioned

challenges a log a log server to prove

2218
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:20,310
challenges a log a log server to prove
 

2219
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:23,450
challenges a log a log server to prove
that each one's log is really a prefix

2220
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:23,460
that each one's log is really a prefix
 

2221
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:27,710
that each one's log is really a prefix
of h2s log what the log server has to

2222
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:27,720
of h2s log what the log server has to
 

2223
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,850
of h2s log what the log server has to
produce is this sequence of other the

2224
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:31,860
produce is this sequence of other the
 

2225
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,430
produce is this sequence of other the
other side of each of the Hat sign tree

2226
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:34,440
other side of each of the Hat sign tree
 

2227
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:39,190
other side of each of the Hat sign tree
head hashes on the way from h1 to h2 and

2228
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:39,200
head hashes on the way from h1 to h2 and
 

2229
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,130
head hashes on the way from h1 to h2 and
this is the proof and then again you

2230
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:43,140
this is the proof and then again you
 

2231
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:46,030
this is the proof and then again you
know this is reminiscent of the

2232
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:46,040
know this is reminiscent of the
 

2233
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:51,010
know this is reminiscent of the
inclusion proofs then to check the proof

2234
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:51,020
inclusion proofs then to check the proof
 

2235
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:54,170
inclusion proofs then to check the proof
you need to take each one hash it with

2236
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:54,180
you need to take each one hash it with
 

2237
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:57,140
you need to take each one hash it with
the first other thing you know hash that

2238
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:57,150
the first other thing you know hash that
 

2239
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:58,670
the first other thing you know hash that
along with the second other things that

2240
00:52:58,670 --> 00:52:58,680
along with the second other things that
 

2241
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,620
along with the second other things that
you get to the last one of these and

2242
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:00,630
you get to the last one of these and
 

2243
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:03,350
you get to the last one of these and
that had better be equal to h2 if it is

2244
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:03,360
that had better be equal to h2 if it is
 

2245
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:08,930
that had better be equal to h2 if it is
it's a proof that h2 is a suffix of each

2246
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:08,940
it's a proof that h2 is a suffix of each
 

2247
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,270
it's a proof that h2 is a suffix of each
one otherwise the log servers evidently

00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:13,280
one otherwise the log servers evidently
 

2249
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,620
one otherwise the log servers evidently
tried to fork you and again you know the

2250
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:18,630
tried to fork you and again you know the
 

2251
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:22,780
tried to fork you and again you know the
basis of this is that there's no other

00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:22,790
basis of this is that there's no other

basis of this is that there's no other
you know h2 really isn't as supposing h1

2254
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:25,980
you know h2 really isn't as supposing h1
 

2255
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,960
you know h2 really isn't as supposing h1
isn't a prefix of h2 there's no way that

2256
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:29,970
isn't a prefix of h2 there's no way that
 

2257
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:34,520
isn't a prefix of h2 there's no way that
uh since h2 was created from some actual

00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:34,530
uh since h2 was created from some actual
 

2259
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:36,710
uh since h2 was created from some actual
log that's not the same as h1 there's no

2261
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,390
log that's not the same as h1 there's no
way that the log server could cook up

00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:40,400
way that the log server could cook up
 

2263
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,900
way that the log server could cook up
these values that are required to cause

the hashes this sort of repeated hash of
 

2267
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:50,900

00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:06,230
alright ok so this is the log

00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:12,700
alright ok so this is the log
consistency proof okay so the question

2278
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:12,710
consistency proof okay so the question
 

2279
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:14,410
consistency proof okay so the question
is who usually challenges the log server

2280
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:14,420
is who usually challenges the log server
 

2281
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,880
is who usually challenges the log server
so I'll actually talk about that in a

2282
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:15,890
so I'll actually talk about that in a
 

2283
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:19,020
so I'll actually talk about that in a
minute but it turns out that um both

2284
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:19,030
minute but it turns out that um both
 

2285
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:25,150

00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,550

well Luke browsers and monitors

00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:28,560
well Luke browsers and monitors

00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,080
well Luke browsers and monitors
challenge the log server you it's

2290
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:30,090
challenge the log server you it's
 

2291
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:31,760
challenge the log server you it's
actually usually the browser's

2292
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:31,770
actually usually the browser's
 

2293
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,590
actually usually the browser's
challenging the log server that's the

2294
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:33,600
challenging the log server that's the
 

2295
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,450
challenging the log server that's the
most important thing but there's two

2296
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:35,460
most important thing but there's two
 

2297
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,590
most important thing but there's two
points in time at which you need to

points in time at which you need to
 

2299
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,910
points in time at which you need to
challenge the log server to produce

challenge the log server to produce
 

2301
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,210
challenge the log server to produce
these proofs and I'll talk about both of

00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:41,220
these proofs and I'll talk about both of
 

2303
00:54:41,220 --> 00:55:00,620
these proofs and I'll talk about both of
them all right okay actually so the

2304
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:00,630
them all right okay actually so the
 

2305
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:06,020
them all right okay actually so the
first place at which one point at which

00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:06,030
first place at which one point at which

2475
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:49,920
new log with a bunch of new stuff on it
and here is the sign tree

00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:49,930
and here is the sign tree
 

2477
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:52,799
and here is the sign tree
of the current log why don't you switch

2478
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:52,809
of the current log why don't you switch
 

2479
00:58:52,809 --> 00:58:54,870

my to use that as your sign tree hit and
so now if that were allowed to happen

2482
00:58:59,160 --> 00:58:59,170
so now if that were allowed to happen
 

2483
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:01,559
so now if that were allowed to happen
then the browser's now would completely

2484
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:01,569
then the browser's now would completely
 

2485
00:59:01,569 --> 00:59:03,329
then the browser's now would completely
lost the evidence that anything went

2486
00:59:03,329 --> 00:59:03,339
lost the evidence that anything went
 

2487
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:04,859
lost the evidence that anything went
wrong because now the browser is using

2488
00:59:04,859 --> 00:59:04,869
wrong because now the browser is using
 

2489
00:59:04,869 --> 00:59:06,930
wrong because now the browser is using
the same trees everybody else no it's

00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,490

00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:08,500
going to contribute this sign tree head
 

2493
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,769
going to contribute this sign tree head
to the gossip pool it's all gonna look

00:59:10,769 --> 00:59:10,779
to the gossip pool it's all gonna look
 

2495
00:59:10,779 --> 00:59:15,269
to the gossip pool it's all gonna look
good and we had this sort of brief evil

2496
00:59:15,269 --> 00:59:15,279
good and we had this sort of brief evil
 

2497
00:59:15,279 --> 00:59:17,549
good and we had this sort of brief evil

2499
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:20,339

evil log Fork but if the browser's are

2500
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:20,349
evil log Fork but if the browser's are
 

2501
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:22,620
evil log Fork but if the browser's are
willing to accept a new sign tree head

00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:22,630
willing to accept a new sign tree head
 

2503
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:25,740
willing to accept a new sign tree head
then we can basically have the browser

00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:25,750
then we can basically have the browser
 

2505
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:30,359
then we can basically have the browser

switching away from that log that is
 

2517
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,809
switching away from that log that is

that we want to be able to enforce that

that we want to be able to enforce that
the browser sees only strict extensions

00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:52,779
the browser sees only strict extensions
 

2521
00:59:52,779 --> 00:59:55,609
the browser sees only strict extensions
to the log that it's seen already and

2522
00:59:55,609 --> 00:59:55,619
to the log that it's seen already and
 

2523
00:59:55,619 --> 00:59:57,809
to the log that it's seen already and
doesn't simply get switched to a log

2524
00:59:57,809 --> 00:59:57,819
doesn't simply get switched to a log
 

2525
00:59:57,819 --> 01:00:00,180
doesn't simply get switched to a log
that is not compatible with the log the

2526
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:00,190
that is not compatible with the log the
 

2527
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:01,950
that is not compatible with the log the
browser seen before it's the property

2528
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:01,960
browser seen before it's the property
 

2529
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,269
browser seen before it's the property
that we're looking for it's actually

2530
01:00:03,269 --> 01:00:03,279
that we're looking for it's actually
 

2531
01:00:03,279 --> 01:00:12,000
that we're looking for it's actually
called for consistency and with any

2532
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:12,010
called for consistency and with any
 

2533
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:14,490
called for consistency and with any
first two is that if the browser's been

2534
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:14,500
first two is that if the browser's been
 

2535
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,470
first two is that if the browser's been
forked onto a different fork from other

2536
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:16,480
forked onto a different fork from other
 

2537
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,960
forked onto a different fork from other
people then they must stay on that fork

2538
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:18,970
people then they must stay on that fork
 

2539
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:22,820
people then they must stay on that fork
in it it should never be able to switch

2540
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:22,830
in it it should never be able to switch
 

2541
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:25,260
in it it should never be able to switch
to the main fork and the reason for that

2542
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:25,270
to the main fork and the reason for that
 

2543
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:27,360
to the main fork and the reason for that
is we want to preserve you need to

2544
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:27,370
is we want to preserve you need to
 

2545
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:29,850
is we want to preserve you need to
preserve this bad sign tree head and its

2546
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:29,860
preserve this bad sign tree head and its
 

2547
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:33,360
preserve this bad sign tree head and its
successors so that when the browser

2548
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:33,370
successors so that when the browser
 

2549
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:36,750
successors so that when the browser
participates in the gossip protocol it's

2550
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:36,760
participates in the gossip protocol it's
 

2551
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:41,490
participates in the gossip protocol it's
contributing sign tree heads that nobody

2552
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:41,500
contributing sign tree heads that nobody
 

2553
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,370
contributing sign tree heads that nobody
else has and that cannot be proved to be

2554
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:44,380
else has and that cannot be proved to be
 

2555
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,440
else has and that cannot be proved to be
compatible using the log consistency

2556
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:46,450
compatible using the log consistency
 

2557
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:48,210
compatible using the log consistency
proof okay so how do we achieve for

2558
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:48,220
proof okay so how do we achieve for
 

2559
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:51,990
proof okay so how do we achieve for
consistency well um it's actually easy

2560
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:52,000
consistency well um it's actually easy
 

2561
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,730
consistency well um it's actually easy
with the tools we have now every time

2562
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:53,740
with the tools we have now every time
 

2563
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:56,460
with the tools we have now every time
the log server tells a browser oh here's

2564
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:56,470
the log server tells a browser oh here's
 

2565
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:58,320
the log server tells a browser oh here's
a new sign tree head for a longer log

2566
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:58,330
a new sign tree head for a longer log
 

2567
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:01,920
a new sign tree head for a longer log
the browser will require the will not

2568
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:01,930
the browser will require the will not
 

2569
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:04,880
the browser will require the will not
accept the new sign tree head until the

2570
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:04,890
accept the new sign tree head until the
 

2571
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:08,220
accept the new sign tree head until the
log server has has produced a log

2572
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:08,230
log server has has produced a log
 

2573
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:10,200
log server has has produced a log
consistency proof that the new sign tree

2574
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:10,210
consistency proof that the new sign tree
 

2575
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:15,540
consistency proof that the new sign tree
head describes a suffix of the old sign

2576
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:15,550
head describes a suffix of the old sign
 

2577
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:17,550
head describes a suffix of the old sign
tree that is that the log of the old

2578
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:17,560
tree that is that the log of the old
 

2579
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,500
tree that is that the log of the old
sign tree has a prefix of the log of the

2580
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:19,510
sign tree has a prefix of the log of the
 

2581
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,750
sign tree has a prefix of the log of the
new sign tree and of course if a log

2582
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:21,760
new sign tree and of course if a log
 

2583
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,240
new sign tree and of course if a log
server is as forked the browser and it's

01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:24,250
server is as forked the browser and it's
 

2585
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:26,610

keeping the browser on that same Fork it

2586
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:26,620
keeping the browser on that same Fork it
 

2587
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,920
keeping the browser on that same Fork it
can produce the proofs but of course you

2588
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:28,930
can produce the proofs but of course you
 

2589
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:30,870
can produce the proofs but of course you
know it's digging its grave even deeper

2590
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:30,880
know it's digging its grave even deeper
 

2591
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,360
know it's digging its grave even deeper
because I'm as producing more and more

01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:33,370
because I'm as producing more and more
 

2593
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:35,790
because I'm as producing more and more
sign tree heads for a which will

okay okay so the system these these log

by gossiping
I'm the two of them together make it

2630
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:27,590
I'm the two of them together make it
 

2631
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:31,480
I'm the two of them together make it
likely that all the participants or

01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:33,340
likely that all the participants or
seeing the same log and that if they're

01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:33,350
seeing the same log and that if they're
 

2635
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:34,960
seeing the same log and that if they're
not seeing the same log they'll be able

01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:34,970
not seeing the same log they'll be able
 

2637
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:38,710
not seeing the same log they'll be able
to detect that fact by the failure of a

2641
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:53,569

any questions

2642
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:53,579

 

2643
01:02:53,579 --> 01:02:58,019

okay so that how many log service are

2644
01:02:58,019 --> 01:02:58,029
okay so that how many log service are
 

2645
01:02:58,029 --> 01:02:59,370
okay so that how many log service are
there that is a great question

2646
01:02:59,370 --> 01:02:59,380
there that is a great question
 

2647
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:02,309
there that is a great question
so I describe the system as if there was

2648
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:02,319
so I describe the system as if there was
 

2649
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:03,720
so I describe the system as if there was
just one log server it turns out in the

2650
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:03,730
just one log server it turns out in the
 

2651
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:05,670
just one log server it turns out in the
real system there's lots of log servers

2652
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:05,680
real system there's lots of log servers
 

2653
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,650
real system there's lots of log servers
at least dozens so this is a deployed

2654
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:07,660
at least dozens so this is a deployed
 

2655
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:09,930
at least dozens so this is a deployed
system which you can programmed in that

2656
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:09,940
system which you can programmed in that
 

2657
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:12,120
system which you can programmed in that
is actually used by Chrome and I think

2658
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:12,130
is actually used by Chrome and I think
 

2659
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:15,870
is actually used by Chrome and I think
Safari there are at least dozens of

2660
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:15,880
Safari there are at least dozens of
 

2661
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,759
Safari there are at least dozens of
these log servers and when certificate

2662
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:17,769
these log servers and when certificate
 

2663
01:03:17,769 --> 01:03:19,170
these log servers and when certificate
and certificate authorities are actually

2664
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:19,180
and certificate authorities are actually
 

2665
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:20,999
and certificate authorities are actually
required by chrome to submit all their

2666
01:03:20,999 --> 01:03:21,009
required by chrome to submit all their
 

2667
01:03:21,009 --> 01:03:25,650
required by chrome to submit all their
certificates to the to the log servers

2668
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:25,660
certificates to the to the log servers
 

2669
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:29,160
certificates to the to the log servers
to multiple log servers the different

01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:29,170
to multiple log servers the different
 

2671
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:30,210
to multiple log servers the different
log servers don't actually keep

2672
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:30,220
log servers don't actually keep
 

2673
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,759
log servers don't actually keep
identical logs the convention is that a

01:03:32,759 --> 01:03:32,769
identical logs the convention is that a
 

2675
01:03:32,769 --> 01:03:34,529
identical logs the convention is that a
certificate authority will submit a new

certificate to save you know a couple
 

2679
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:41,180
certificate to save you know a couple
maybe five different log servers and

actually in the certificate information
 

2683
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,289
actually in the certificate information
that a website tells your browser it

that a website tells your browser it

servers that have the certificate in
 

2691
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,789
servers that have the certificate in
their log so your browser knows which

log servers to talk to and the reason

01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:03,359
log servers to talk to and the reason
why there's more than one of them is of

why there's more than one of them is of
 

2697
01:04:03,369 --> 01:04:05,160
why there's more than one of them is of
course some of them may go bad some of

01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:06,989
course some of them may go bad some of
them may turn out to be malicious or go

01:04:06,989 --> 01:04:06,999
them may turn out to be malicious or go
 

2701
01:04:06,999 --> 01:04:09,479
them may turn out to be malicious or go
out of business or who knows what and in

out of business or who knows what and in
 

2703
01:04:09,489 --> 01:04:10,739
out of business or who knows what and in
that case you still want to have a

2704
01:04:10,739 --> 01:04:10,749
that case you still want to have a
 

2705
01:04:10,749 --> 01:04:15,329
that case you still want to have a
couple more to fall back on they don't

2706
01:04:15,329 --> 01:04:15,339
couple more to fall back on they don't
 

2707
01:04:15,339 --> 01:04:17,430
couple more to fall back on they don't
have to be identical because they don't

2708
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:17,440
have to be identical because they don't
 

2709
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,339
have to be identical because they don't
as long as the certificate is in at

01:04:20,349 --> 01:04:23,729
as long as the certificate is in at

anybody knows is trustworthy that's
 

2715
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:32,819
anybody knows is trustworthy that's
sufficient because you know the issue

01:04:32,819 --> 01:04:32,829
sufficient because you know the issue

here
 

2719
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:36,099
here
not really necessarily the fact that the

not really necessarily the fact that the
 

2721
01:04:36,109 --> 01:04:37,720
not really necessarily the fact that the
log had the certificate in it because

2722
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:37,730
log had the certificate in it because
 

2723
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:40,539
log had the certificate in it because
that's not proof that the certificate is

that's not proof that the certificate is
 

2725
01:04:40,549 --> 01:04:43,240
that's not proof that the certificate is
good all we're looking for is log

2726
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:43,250
good all we're looking for is log
 

2727
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:47,740
good all we're looking for is log
servers that aren't forking the monitors

2728
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:47,750
servers that aren't forking the monitors
 

2729
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:50,950
servers that aren't forking the monitors
and browsers that use them so it's

2730
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:50,960
and browsers that use them so it's
 

2731
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,779
and browsers that use them so it's
enough for a certificate to be in even a

01:04:52,779 --> 01:04:52,789
enough for a certificate to be in even a
 

2733
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:56,589
enough for a certificate to be in even a
single log server that's not forking

2734
01:04:56,589 --> 01:04:56,599
single log server that's not forking
 

2735
01:04:56,599 --> 01:04:58,809
single log server that's not forking
people because then the monitors are

2736
01:04:58,809 --> 01:04:58,819
people because then the monitors are
 

2737
01:04:58,819 --> 01:04:59,920
people because then the monitors are
guaranteed to see it because the

2738
01:04:59,920 --> 01:04:59,930
guaranteed to see it because the
 

2739
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:04,450
guaranteed to see it because the
monitors check all the log servers so if

2740
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:04,460
monitors check all the log servers so if
 

2741
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:06,250
monitors check all the log servers so if
a bogus certificate shows up even even a

01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:06,260
a bogus certificate shows up even even a
 

2743
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:07,960
a bogus certificate shows up even even a
single log server the monitors will

2744
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:07,970
single log server the monitors will
 

2745
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:10,539
single log server the monitors will
eventually notice because all the

2746
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:10,549
eventually notice because all the
 

2747
01:05:10,549 --> 01:05:15,190
eventually notice because all the
monitors look at all the log servers

2748
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:15,200
monitors look at all the log servers
 

2749
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,599
monitors look at all the log servers
that the browsers are willing to accept

2750
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:18,609
that the browsers are willing to accept
 

2751
01:05:18,609 --> 01:05:22,240
that the browsers are willing to accept
all right another question what prevents

2752
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:22,250
all right another question what prevents
 

2753
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:25,299
all right another question what prevents
a log server from going down and issuing

2754
01:05:25,299 --> 01:05:25,309
a log server from going down and issuing
 

2755
01:05:25,309 --> 01:05:28,480
a log server from going down and issuing
bogus certificates before they get

2756
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:28,490
bogus certificates before they get
 

2757
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:31,180
bogus certificates before they get
caught you know nothing actually if

2758
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:31,190
caught you know nothing actually if
 

2759
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:34,390
caught you know nothing actually if
you're willing to that's definitely a

2760
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:34,400
you're willing to that's definitely a
 

2761
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,549
you're willing to that's definitely a
defect in the system that at least for a

01:05:36,549 --> 01:05:36,559
defect in the system that at least for a
 

2763
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,859
defect in the system that at least for a

malicious log server contributing bogus

2766
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:43,640
malicious log server contributing bogus
 

2767
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:44,710
malicious log server contributing bogus
certificates so if you have a

2768
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:44,720
certificates so if you have a
 

2769
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,410
certificates so if you have a
certificate authority that's become

2770
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:47,420
certificate authority that's become
 

2771
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:49,599
certificate authority that's become
malicious and this issuing bogus

2772
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:49,609
malicious and this issuing bogus
 

2773
01:05:49,609 --> 01:05:51,910
malicious and this issuing bogus
certificates they look correct but

2774
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:51,920
certificates they look correct but
 

2775
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:59,049
certificates they look correct but
they're bogus and a log server then that

2776
01:05:59,049 --> 01:05:59,059
they're bogus and a log server then that
 

2777
01:05:59,059 --> 01:06:00,579
they're bogus and a log server then that
that's willing to serve these it's

2778
01:06:00,579 --> 01:06:00,589
that's willing to serve these it's
 

2779
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:01,839
that's willing to serve these it's
willing to put these certificates in the

2780
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:01,849
willing to put these certificates in the
 

2781
01:06:01,849 --> 01:06:03,999
willing to put these certificates in the
log and of course they all are then at

2782
01:06:03,999 --> 01:06:04,009
log and of course they all are then at
 

2783
01:06:04,009 --> 01:06:05,769
log and of course they all are then at
least for a while browsers will be

2784
01:06:05,769 --> 01:06:05,779
least for a while browsers will be
 

2785
01:06:05,779 --> 01:06:07,150
least for a while browsers will be
willing to use them the thing is though

2786
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:07,160
willing to use them the thing is though
 

2787
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,430
willing to use them the thing is though
that the you know they will be caught

2788
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:09,440
that the you know they will be caught
 

2789
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,160
that the you know they will be caught
and this is the system is its intent is

2790
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:12,170
and this is the system is its intent is
 

2791
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:15,430
and this is the system is its intent is
to improve the situation in the priests

2792
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:15,440
to improve the situation in the priests
 

2793
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,920
to improve the situation in the priests
or to make a transparency system if

2794
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:17,930
or to make a transparency system if
 

2795
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:19,749
or to make a transparency system if
somebody was issuing bogus certificates

2796
01:06:19,749 --> 01:06:19,759
somebody was issuing bogus certificates
 

2797
01:06:19,759 --> 01:06:21,400
somebody was issuing bogus certificates
and browsers were being tricked into

2798
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:21,410
and browsers were being tricked into
 

2799
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,620
and browsers were being tricked into
using them you might never find out ever

2800
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:23,630
using them you might never find out ever
 

2801
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:26,289
using them you might never find out ever
in the certificate transparency world

2802
01:06:26,289 --> 01:06:26,299
in the certificate transparency world
 

2803
01:06:26,299 --> 01:06:28,450
in the certificate transparency world
you may not find out right away and so

2804
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:28,460
you may not find out right away and so
 

2805
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:30,990
you may not find out right away and so
some some people may use them but then

2806
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:31,000
some some people may use them but then
 

2807
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,950
some some people may use them but then
relatively quickly you know a few days

2808
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:32,960
relatively quickly you know a few days
 

2809
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,049
relatively quickly you know a few days
or something the monitors will start to

2810
01:06:35,049 --> 01:06:35,059
or something the monitors will start to
 

2811
01:06:35,059 --> 01:06:37,120
or something the monitors will start to
notice that there's bad certificates in

2812
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:37,130
notice that there's bad certificates in
 

2813
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:39,819
notice that there's bad certificates in
the logs and somebody will go and track

2814
01:06:39,819 --> 01:06:39,829
the logs and somebody will go and track
 

2815
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,980
the logs and somebody will go and track
it down and figure out who is malicious

2816
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:41,990
it down and figure out who is malicious
 

2817
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:52,730
it down and figure out who is malicious
or who is making mistakes

2818
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:52,740

 

2819
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:56,839

yeah so I guess a certificate a

2820
01:06:56,839 --> 01:06:56,849
yeah so I guess a certificate a
 

2821
01:06:56,849 --> 01:06:58,460
yeah so I guess a certificate a
certificate transparency law could

2822
01:06:58,460 --> 01:06:58,470
certificate transparency law could
 

2823
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:02,089
certificate transparency law could
refuse to talk to the monitors yeah I'm

2824
01:07:02,089 --> 01:07:02,099
refuse to talk to the monitors yeah I'm
 

2825
01:07:02,099 --> 01:07:08,240
refuse to talk to the monitors yeah I'm
not sure I think ultimately the if you

2826
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:08,250
not sure I think ultimately the if you
 

2827
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,589
not sure I think ultimately the if you
know we're now treading into a kind of

2828
01:07:09,589 --> 01:07:09,599
know we're now treading into a kind of
 

2829
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,930
know we're now treading into a kind of
non-technical region you know what to do

2830
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:11,940
non-technical region you know what to do
 

2831
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:13,940
non-technical region you know what to do
if there's evidence that something's

2832
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:13,950
if there's evidence that something's
 

2833
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:15,799
if there's evidence that something's
gone wrong this is actually quite hard

2834
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:15,809
gone wrong this is actually quite hard
 

2835
01:07:15,809 --> 01:07:18,260
gone wrong this is actually quite hard
because much of the time is something

2836
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:18,270
because much of the time is something
 

2837
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:20,000
because much of the time is something
seems to go wrong even bogus

01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,010
seems to go wrong even bogus
 

2839
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:22,910
seems to go wrong even bogus
certificates often often the reason it's

2840
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:22,920
certificates often often the reason it's
 

2841
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,319
certificates often often the reason it's
just somebody made a mistake it was a

2842
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:24,329
just somebody made a mistake it was a
 

2843
01:07:24,329 --> 01:07:26,480
just somebody made a mistake it was a
legitimate mistake you know somebody

2844
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:26,490
legitimate mistake you know somebody
 

2845
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:28,849
legitimate mistake you know somebody
blew it and it's not evidence of malice

2846
01:07:28,849 --> 01:07:28,859
blew it and it's not evidence of malice
 

2847
01:07:28,859 --> 01:07:31,150
blew it and it's not evidence of malice
is just that somebody made a mistake I

2848
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:31,160
is just that somebody made a mistake I
 

2849

think what would happen if a monitor was

2850
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:33,480
think what would happen if a monitor was
 

2851
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,870
think what would happen if a monitor was
misbehaving in almost any way like not

2852
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:35,880
misbehaving in almost any way like not
 

2853
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,790
misbehaving in almost any way like not
answering requests if it was doing

consistently people notice and either

01:07:41,450 --> 01:07:41,460
consistently people notice and either

ask them to shape up or take them out of

01:07:43,849 --> 01:07:43,859
ask them to shape up or take them out of
 

2859
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:44,329
ask them to shape up or take them out of
the list

2860
01:07:44,329 --> 01:07:44,339
the list
 

2861
01:07:44,339 --> 01:07:46,400
the list
stop using them the browser vendors

2862
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:46,410
stop using them the browser vendors
 

2863
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:48,680
stop using them the browser vendors
would take that logs her out of a list

2864
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:48,690
would take that logs her out of a list
 

2865
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:50,750
would take that logs her out of a list
of acceptable log servers after a while

2866
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:50,760
of acceptable log servers after a while
 

2867
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,870
of acceptable log servers after a while
but yeah there's like a gray area of bad

2868
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:53,880
but yeah there's like a gray area of bad
 

2869
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,180
but yeah there's like a gray area of bad
behavior that's not bad enough to the

2870
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:56,190
behavior that's not bad enough to the
 

2871
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:57,289
behavior that's not bad enough to the
warrant being taken out of the

2872
01:07:57,289 --> 01:07:57,299
warrant being taken out of the
 

2873
01:07:57,299 --> 01:08:00,620
warrant being taken out of the
acceptable list I think of a log server

2874
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:00,630
acceptable list I think of a log server
 

2875
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:01,970
acceptable list I think of a log server
has been found to work the question is

2876
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:01,980
has been found to work the question is
 

2877
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,170
has been found to work the question is
what if the log server has been found

2878
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:03,180
what if the log server has been found
 

2879
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:07,640
what if the log server has been found
before what happens then I think I think

2880
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:07,650
before what happens then I think I think
 

2881
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,020
before what happens then I think I think
what would happen is the people who were

2882
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:09,030
what would happen is the people who were
 

2883
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:11,750
what would happen is the people who were
run you know the people who the browser

2884
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:11,760
run you know the people who the browser
 

2885
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,710
run you know the people who the browser
vendors would talk to the log server and

2886
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:15,720
vendors would talk to the log server and
 

2887
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,090
vendors would talk to the log server and
ask them the people running the log

2888
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:17,100
ask them the people running the log
 

2889
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,970
ask them the people running the log
server and ask them what happened and if

2890
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:19,980
server and ask them what happened and if
 

2891
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,019

they came up with a convincing

2892
01:08:21,019 --> 01:08:21,029
they came up with a convincing
 

2893
01:08:21,029 --> 01:08:22,400
they came up with a convincing
explanation that they didn't made a

2894
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:22,410
explanation that they didn't made a
 

2895
01:08:22,410 --> 01:08:24,919
explanation that they didn't made a
mistake you know which maybe they

2896
01:08:24,919 --> 01:08:24,929
mistake you know which maybe they
 

2897
01:08:24,929 --> 01:08:26,720
mistake you know which maybe they
couldn't maybe I don't know they their

2898
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:26,730
couldn't maybe I don't know they their
 

2899
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:28,610
couldn't maybe I don't know they their
machine crashes it loses part of their

01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:28,620
machine crashes it loses part of their
 

2901
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:31,459

01:08:31,459 --> 01:08:31,469
log they restart you know starting from
 

2903
01:08:31,469 --> 01:08:34,519

a prefix of the log and start growing a

2904
01:08:34,519 --> 01:08:34,529
a prefix of the log and start growing a
 

2905
01:08:34,529 --> 01:08:37,820
a prefix of the log and start growing a
different log if it seems like a mistake

2906
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:37,830
different log if it seems like a mistake
 

2907
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:41,240
different log if it seems like a mistake
honest mistake then well it was a

2908
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:41,250
honest mistake then well it was a
 

2909
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:44,329
honest mistake then well it was a
mistake but if it if the log server

2910
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:44,339
mistake but if it if the log server
 

2911
01:08:44,339 --> 01:08:46,519

operators can't provide a convincing

01:08:46,519 --> 01:08:46,529
operators can't provide a convincing
 

2913
01:08:46,529 --> 01:08:48,289
operators can't provide a convincing
explanation of what happened then I

2914
01:08:48,289 --> 01:08:48,299
explanation of what happened then I
 

2915
01:08:48,299 --> 01:08:49,849
explanation of what happened then I
think the browser vendors would just

2916
01:08:49,849 --> 01:08:49,859
think the browser vendors would just
 

2917
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:53,630
think the browser vendors would just
delete them from the list of acceptable

2918
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:53,640

 

2919
01:08:53,640 --> 01:09:02,590

klog servers okay but these are you know

2920
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:02,600
klog servers okay but these are you know
 

2921
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:06,230
klog servers okay but these are you know
these are sort of problems with the

2922
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:06,240
these are sort of problems with the
 

2923
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:09,320
these are sort of problems with the
system because you can you know the

2924
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:09,330
system because you can you know the
 

2925
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:11,330
system because you can you know the
definitions of like who owns a name or

2926
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:11,340
definitions of like who owns a name or
 

2927
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:13,010
definitions of like who owns a name or
what acceptable but you know whether

2928
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:13,020
what acceptable but you know whether
 

2929
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:14,720
what acceptable but you know whether
it's okay for your server to be down or

2930
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:14,730
it's okay for your server to be down or
 

2931
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:18,460
it's okay for your server to be down or
not these are very hard to pin down

2932
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:18,470
not these are very hard to pin down
 

2933
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:24,710
not these are very hard to pin down
properties you know I think the system

2934
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:24,720
properties you know I think the system
 

2935
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,810
properties you know I think the system
is not full you could definitely get

2936
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:26,820
is not full you could definitely get
 

2937
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:28,490
is not full you could definitely get
away with bad behavior at least for a

2938
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:28,500
away with bad behavior at least for a
 

2939
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:32,210
away with bad behavior at least for a
while but the hope is that there's

2940
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:32,220
while but the hope is that there's
 

2941
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:35,980
while but the hope is that there's
strong enough auditing here that if some

2942
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:35,990
strong enough auditing here that if some
 

2943
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:39,080
strong enough auditing here that if some
certificate authority or log server was

2944
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:39,090
certificate authority or log server was
 

2945
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:42,830
certificate authority or log server was
persistently badly behaved that people

2946
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:42,840
persistently badly behaved that people
 

2947
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,210
persistently badly behaved that people
would notice the monitors would notice

2948
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:44,220
would notice the monitors would notice
 

2949
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,710
would notice the monitors would notice
they may not do anything for a while but

2950
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:45,720
they may not do anything for a while but
 

2951
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:50,030
they may not do anything for a while but
eventually they would decide that you

2952
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:50,040
eventually they would decide that you
 

2953
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,190
eventually they would decide that you
know you're either too much of a pain or

2954
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:52,200
know you're either too much of a pain or
 

2955
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,220
know you're either too much of a pain or
to malicious to be part of the system

2956
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:54,230
to malicious to be part of the system
 

2957
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:58,430
to malicious to be part of the system
and delete you from the browser lists of

2958
01:09:58,430 --> 01:09:58,440
and delete you from the browser lists of
 

2959
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:59,900
and delete you from the browser lists of
course they split the browser vendors in

2960
01:09:59,900 --> 01:09:59,910
course they split the browser vendors in
 

2961
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:03,050
course they split the browser vendors in
a position of quite strong power so Wow

2962
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:03,060
a position of quite strong power so Wow
 

2963
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:04,310
a position of quite strong power so Wow
the system is in general pretty

2964
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:04,320
the system is in general pretty
 

2965
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,140
the system is in general pretty
decentralized yeah there can be lots of

2966
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:06,150
decentralized yeah there can be lots of
 

2967
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:08,260
decentralized yeah there can be lots of
certificate authorities and lots of

2968
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:08,270
certificate authorities and lots of
 

2969
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:10,460
certificate authorities and lots of
certificate transparency log servers

2970
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:10,470
certificate transparency log servers
 

2971
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:12,530
certificate transparency log servers
there's only a handful of browser

2972
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:12,540
there's only a handful of browser
 

2973
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:15,440
there's only a handful of browser
vendors and that there because they

2974
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:15,450
vendors and that there because they
 

2975
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:17,870
vendors and that there because they
maintain the lists of acceptable

2976
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:17,880
maintain the lists of acceptable
 

2977
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,890
maintain the lists of acceptable
certificate authorities and log servers

2978
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:21,900
certificate authorities and log servers
 

2979
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:26,380
certificate authorities and log servers
they do have a lot of power and you know

2980
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:26,390
they do have a lot of power and you know
 

2981
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:31,100
they do have a lot of power and you know
it's the way it is unfortunately okay so

2982
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:31,110
it's the way it is unfortunately okay so
 

2983
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:35,480
it's the way it is unfortunately okay so
things to take away from a certificate

2984
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:35,490
things to take away from a certificate
 

2985
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:38,090
things to take away from a certificate
transparency design so one thing is the

2986
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:38,100
transparency design so one thing is the
 

2987
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,670
transparency design so one thing is the
key property it has super important is

2988
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:40,680
key property it has super important is
 

2989
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,840
key property it has super important is
just that everyone sees the same log

2990
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:43,850

01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:10,050
the monitors can detect problems and
therefore the browser's even though the

01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:10,060
therefore the browser's even though the
 

3013

01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:11,860
browsers can't actually detect bogus
 

3015
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:13,380
browsers can't actually detect bogus
certificates they can at least be

3016
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:13,390

3017
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:14,970

3021
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:19,500

01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:19,510
will detect them and possibly put them
 

3023
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:20,790
will detect them and possibly put them
on revocation lists actually that's

3024
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:20,800
on revocation lists actually that's
 

3025
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,820
on revocation lists actually that's
something I didn't mention if if there's

3026
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:23,830
something I didn't mention if if there's

a bogus certificate like MIT sees

3030
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:29,199
a bogus certificate like MIT sees
 

3031
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:32,250
a bogus certificate like MIT sees
somebody they don't know about being

3032
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:32,260
somebody they don't know about being
 

3033
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:34,860
somebody they don't know about being
issued a certificate for MIT did you it

3034
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:34,870
issued a certificate for MIT did you it
 

3035
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:35,930
issued a certificate for MIT did you it
turns out there's a pre-existing

3036
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:35,940
turns out there's a pre-existing
 

3037
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:38,729
turns out there's a pre-existing
revocation service that you can put bad

3038
01:11:38,729 --> 01:11:38,739
revocation service that you can put bad
 

3039
01:11:38,739 --> 01:11:41,459
revocation service that you can put bad
certificates on that the browser's check

3040
01:11:41,459 --> 01:11:41,469
certificates on that the browser's check
 

3041
01:11:41,469 --> 01:11:44,400
certificates on that the browser's check
so if a monitor sees a bogus certificate

3042
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:44,410
so if a monitor sees a bogus certificate
 

3043
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:46,169
so if a monitor sees a bogus certificate
it can actually be effectively disabled

3044
01:11:46,169 --> 01:11:46,179
it can actually be effectively disabled
 

3045
01:11:46,179 --> 01:11:49,340
it can actually be effectively disabled
by putting it on in the revocation

3046
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:49,350
by putting it on in the revocation
 

3047
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:51,870
by putting it on in the revocation
certificate revocation system that's not

3048
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:51,880
certificate revocation system that's not
 

3049
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,430
certificate revocation system that's not
part of certificate transparency it's

3050
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:53,440
part of certificate transparency it's
 

3051
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:57,209
part of certificate transparency it's
been around for a long time okay so the

3052
01:11:57,209 --> 01:11:57,219
been around for a long time okay so the
 

3053
01:11:57,219 --> 01:11:58,590
been around for a long time okay so the
key property is everyone sees the same

3054
01:11:58,590 --> 01:11:58,600
key property is everyone sees the same
 

3055
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:02,580
key property is everyone sees the same
log of certificates another thing to

01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:02,590
log of certificates another thing to
 

3057
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:04,830
log of certificates another thing to
take away from this is that if you can't

3058
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:04,840
take away from this is that if you can't
 

3059
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,370
take away from this is that if you can't
figure out a way to prevent bad behavior

3060
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:07,380
figure out a way to prevent bad behavior
 

3061
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:10,250
figure out a way to prevent bad behavior
maybe you can build something these

3069
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:21,180

actually typically not possible to
notice that there has been a fork so if

3116
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:17,140
notice that there has been a fork so if
 

3117
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:18,570
notice that there has been a fork so if
you want to detect Forks there has to be

3118
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:18,580
you want to detect Forks there has to be
 

3119
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:19,860
you want to detect Forks there has to be
one way or another

some kind of gossip some kind of
communication between the parties so

3124
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:23,830
communication between the parties so
 

3125
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:26,300
communication between the parties so
they can compare notes and detect forks

3126
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:26,310
they can compare notes and detect forks
 

3127
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:30,980
they can compare notes and detect forks
and we'll see most of these things again

3128
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:30,990
and we'll see most of these things again
 

3129
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:36,800
and we'll see most of these things again
next week when we look at Bitcoin and

01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:36,810
next week when we look at Bitcoin and
 

3131
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:40,710
next week when we look at Bitcoin and
that's all I had to say
