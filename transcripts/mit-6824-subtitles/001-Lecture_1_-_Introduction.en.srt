1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,200

all right let's get started

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,210
all right let's get started
 

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:11,810
all right let's get started
this is 682 for distributed systems so

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:11,820
this is 682 for distributed systems so
 

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,220
this is 682 for distributed systems so
I'd like to start with just a brief

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:13,230
I'd like to start with just a brief
 

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,629
I'd like to start with just a brief
explanation of what I think a

8
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:14,639
explanation of what I think a
 

9
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,950
explanation of what I think a
distributed system is you know the core

10
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
distributed system is you know the core
 

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,620
distributed system is you know the core
of it is a set of cooperating computers

12
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:21,630
of it is a set of cooperating computers
 

13
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,180
of it is a set of cooperating computers
that are communicating with each other

14
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:23,190
that are communicating with each other
 

15
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,180
that are communicating with each other
over networked to get some coherent task

16
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:26,190
over networked to get some coherent task
 

17
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,720
over networked to get some coherent task
done and so the kinds of examples that

18
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:29,730
done and so the kinds of examples that
 

19
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,520
done and so the kinds of examples that
we'll be focusing on in this class are

20
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:31,530
we'll be focusing on in this class are
 

21
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,960
we'll be focusing on in this class are
things like storage for big websites or

22
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:34,970
things like storage for big websites or
 

23
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,650
things like storage for big websites or
big data computations such as MapReduce

24
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:38,660
big data computations such as MapReduce
 

25
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,750
big data computations such as MapReduce
and also somewhat more exotic things

26
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
and also somewhat more exotic things
 

27
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,940
and also somewhat more exotic things
like peer-to-peer file sharing so

28
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:43,950
like peer-to-peer file sharing so
 

29
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,860
like peer-to-peer file sharing so
they're all just examples the kinds of

30
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:45,870
they're all just examples the kinds of
 

31
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,319
they're all just examples the kinds of
case studies we'll look at and the

32
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:48,329
case studies we'll look at and the
 

33
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:49,790
case studies we'll look at and the
reason why all this is important is that

34
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:49,800
reason why all this is important is that
 

35
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,590
reason why all this is important is that
a lot of critical infrastructure out

36
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
a lot of critical infrastructure out
 

37
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,479
a lot of critical infrastructure out
there is built out of distributed

38
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:53,489
there is built out of distributed
 

39
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,240
there is built out of distributed
systems infrastructure that requires

40
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,250
systems infrastructure that requires
 

41
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,560
systems infrastructure that requires
more than one computer to get its job

42
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:57,570
more than one computer to get its job
 

43
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,569
more than one computer to get its job
done or it's sort of inherently needs to

44
00:00:59,569 --> 00:00:59,579
done or it's sort of inherently needs to
 

45
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,009
done or it's sort of inherently needs to
be spread out physically so the reasons

46
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:04,019
be spread out physically so the reasons
 

47
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,290
be spread out physically so the reasons
why people build this stuff so first of

48
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:06,300
why people build this stuff so first of
 

49
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,180
why people build this stuff so first of
all before I even talk about distributed

50
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:08,190
all before I even talk about distributed
 

51
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,490
all before I even talk about distributed
systems sort of remind you that you know

52
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:10,500
systems sort of remind you that you know
 

53
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,410
systems sort of remind you that you know
if you're designing a system redesigning

54
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:12,420
if you're designing a system redesigning
 

55
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,270
if you're designing a system redesigning
you need to solve some problem if you

56
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:14,280
you need to solve some problem if you
 

57
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,399
you need to solve some problem if you
can possibly solve it on a single

58
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:16,409
can possibly solve it on a single
 

59
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,560
can possibly solve it on a single
computer you know without building a

60
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:18,570
computer you know without building a
 

61
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,090
computer you know without building a
distributed system you should do it that

62
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:20,100
distributed system you should do it that
 

63
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,330
distributed system you should do it that
way and there's many many jobs you can

64
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:23,340
way and there's many many jobs you can
 

65
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,070
way and there's many many jobs you can
get done on a single computer and it's

66
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:25,080
get done on a single computer and it's
 

67
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,210
get done on a single computer and it's
always easier so distributed systems you

68
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:29,220
always easier so distributed systems you
 

69
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,770
always easier so distributed systems you
know you should try everything else

70
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:30,780
know you should try everything else
 

71
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,390
know you should try everything else
before you try building distributed

72
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,400
before you try building distributed
 

73
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,010
before you try building distributed
systems because they're not they're not

74
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,020
systems because they're not they're not
 

75
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,620
systems because they're not they're not
simpler so the reason why people are

76
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:36,630
simpler so the reason why people are
 

77
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,050
simpler so the reason why people are
driven to use lots of cooperating

78
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:39,060
driven to use lots of cooperating
 

79
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,630
driven to use lots of cooperating
computers are they need to get

80
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,640
computers are they need to get
 

81
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,340
computers are they need to get
high-performance and the way to think

82
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:43,350
high-performance and the way to think
 

83
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,170
high-performance and the way to think
about that is they want to get achieve

84
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:45,180
about that is they want to get achieve
 

85
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,510
about that is they want to get achieve
some sort of parallelism lots of CPUs

86
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:50,520
some sort of parallelism lots of CPUs
 

87
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,399
some sort of parallelism lots of CPUs
lots of memories lots of disk arms

88
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:52,409
lots of memories lots of disk arms
 

89
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,570
lots of memories lots of disk arms
moving in parallel another reason why

90
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:56,580
moving in parallel another reason why
 

91
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,280
moving in parallel another reason why
people build this stuff is to be able to

92
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,290
people build this stuff is to be able to
 

93
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:05,300
people build this stuff is to be able to
tolerate faults

94
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:05,310

 

95
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,890

have two computers do the exact same

96
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:07,900
have two computers do the exact same
 

97
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,570
have two computers do the exact same
thing if one of them fails you can cut

98
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:09,580
thing if one of them fails you can cut
 

99
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,600
thing if one of them fails you can cut
over to the other one another is that

100
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:12,610
over to the other one another is that
 

101
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,060
over to the other one another is that
some problems are just naturally spread

102
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,070
some problems are just naturally spread
 

103
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,550
some problems are just naturally spread
out in space like you know you want to

104
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:17,560
out in space like you know you want to
 

105
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,410
out in space like you know you want to
do interbank transfers of money or

106
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:19,420
do interbank transfers of money or
 

107
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,810
do interbank transfers of money or
something well you know bank a has this

108
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:21,820
something well you know bank a has this
 

109
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,970
something well you know bank a has this
computer in New York City and Bank B as

110
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:23,980
computer in New York City and Bank B as
 

111
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,100
computer in New York City and Bank B as
this computer in London you know you

112
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,110
this computer in London you know you
 

113
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,780
this computer in London you know you
just have to have some way for them to

114
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:27,790
just have to have some way for them to
 

115
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,699
just have to have some way for them to
talk to each other and cooperate in

116
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:29,709
talk to each other and cooperate in
 

117
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:31,320
talk to each other and cooperate in
order to carry that out so there's some

118
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,330
order to carry that out so there's some
 

119
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,300
order to carry that out so there's some
natural sort of physical reasons systems

120
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:36,310
natural sort of physical reasons systems
 

121
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,350
natural sort of physical reasons systems
that are inherently physically

122
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
that are inherently physically
 

123
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,990
that are inherently physically
distributed for the final reason that

124
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
distributed for the final reason that
 

125
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,030
distributed for the final reason that
people build this stuff is in order to

126
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,040
people build this stuff is in order to
 

127
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,310
people build this stuff is in order to
achieve some sort of security goal so

128
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:44,320
achieve some sort of security goal so
 

129
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,650
achieve some sort of security goal so
often by if there's some code you don't

130
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:46,660
often by if there's some code you don't
 

131
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,080
often by if there's some code you don't
trust or you know you need to interact

132
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,090
trust or you know you need to interact
 

133
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,910
trust or you know you need to interact
with somebody but you know they may not

134
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:50,920
with somebody but you know they may not
 

135
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,160
with somebody but you know they may not
be immediate malicious or maybe their

136
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,170
be immediate malicious or maybe their
 

137
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,410
be immediate malicious or maybe their
code has bugs in it so you don't want to

138
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:55,420
code has bugs in it so you don't want to
 

139
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,150
code has bugs in it so you don't want to
have to trust it you may want to split

140
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,160
have to trust it you may want to split
 

141
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,340
have to trust it you may want to split
up the computation so you know your

142
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,350
up the computation so you know your
 

143
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,990
up the computation so you know your
stuff runs over there and that computer

144
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,000
stuff runs over there and that computer
 

145
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,490
stuff runs over there and that computer
my stuff runs here on this computer and

146
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:02,500
my stuff runs here on this computer and
 

147
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,140
my stuff runs here on this computer and
they only talk to each other to some

148
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,150
they only talk to each other to some
 

149
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,570
they only talk to each other to some
sort of narrow narrowly defined network

150
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:06,580
sort of narrow narrowly defined network
 

151
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,320
sort of narrow narrowly defined network
protocol assuming we may be worried

152
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,330
protocol assuming we may be worried
 

153
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,560
protocol assuming we may be worried
about you know security and that's

154
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:13,570
about you know security and that's
 

155
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,970
about you know security and that's
achieved by splitting things up into

156
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:14,980
achieved by splitting things up into
 

157
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,410
achieved by splitting things up into
multiple computers so that they can be

158
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:16,420
multiple computers so that they can be
 

159
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,449
multiple computers so that they can be
isolated the most of this course is

160
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:21,459
isolated the most of this course is
 

161
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:23,910
isolated the most of this course is
going to be about performance and fault

162
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
going to be about performance and fault
 

163
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,400
going to be about performance and fault
tolerance although the other two often

164
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,410
tolerance although the other two often
 

165
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,620
tolerance although the other two often
work themselves in by way of the sort of

166
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:28,630
work themselves in by way of the sort of
 

167
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,060
work themselves in by way of the sort of
constraints on the case studies that

168
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,070
constraints on the case studies that
 

169
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,789
constraints on the case studies that
we're going to look at you know all

170
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
we're going to look at you know all
 

171
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,380
we're going to look at you know all
these distributed systems so these

172
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:34,390
these distributed systems so these
 

173
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,420
these distributed systems so these
problems are because they have many

174
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:36,430
problems are because they have many
 

175
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,800
problems are because they have many
parts and the parts execute concurrently

176
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:39,810
parts and the parts execute concurrently
 

177
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,210
parts and the parts execute concurrently
because there are multiple computers you

178
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:42,220
because there are multiple computers you
 

179
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,500
because there are multiple computers you
get all the problems that come up with

180
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:43,510
get all the problems that come up with
 

181
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,180
get all the problems that come up with
concurrent programming all the sort of

182
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:45,190
concurrent programming all the sort of
 

183
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,710
concurrent programming all the sort of
complex interactions and we're

184
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:46,720
complex interactions and we're
 

185
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,650
complex interactions and we're
timing-dependent stuff and that's part

186
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:49,660
timing-dependent stuff and that's part
 

187
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,770
timing-dependent stuff and that's part
of what makes distributed systems hard

188
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:51,780
of what makes distributed systems hard
 

189
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,330
of what makes distributed systems hard
another thing that makes distributed

190
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:54,340
another thing that makes distributed
 

191
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,910
another thing that makes distributed
systems hard is that because again you

192
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:56,920
systems hard is that because again you
 

193
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,400
systems hard is that because again you
have multiple pieces plus a network you

194
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,410
have multiple pieces plus a network you
 

195
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,430
have multiple pieces plus a network you
can have very unexpected failure

196
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:02,440
can have very unexpected failure
 

197
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,530
can have very unexpected failure
patterns that is if you have a single

198
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:04,540
patterns that is if you have a single
 

199
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,270
patterns that is if you have a single
computer it's usually the case either

200
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:06,280
computer it's usually the case either
 

201
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,340
computer it's usually the case either
computer works or maybe it crashes or

202
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:08,350
computer works or maybe it crashes or
 

203
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,040
computer works or maybe it crashes or
suffers a power failure or something but

204
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,050
suffers a power failure or something but
 

205
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,270
suffers a power failure or something but
it pretty much either works or doesn't

206
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:12,280
it pretty much either works or doesn't
 

207
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,460
it pretty much either works or doesn't
work distributed systems made up of lots

208
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:14,470
work distributed systems made up of lots
 

209
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,930
work distributed systems made up of lots
of computers you can have partial

210
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:15,940
of computers you can have partial
 

211
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,390
of computers you can have partial
failures that is some pieces stopped

212
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
failures that is some pieces stopped
 

213
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,130
failures that is some pieces stopped
working other people other pieces

214
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:20,140
working other people other pieces
 

215
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,440
working other people other pieces
continue working or maybe the computers

216
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:22,450
continue working or maybe the computers
 

217
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,270
continue working or maybe the computers
are working but some part of the network

218
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:24,280
are working but some part of the network
 

219
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,990
are working but some part of the network
is broken or unreliable so partial

220
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
is broken or unreliable so partial
 

221
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,860
is broken or unreliable so partial
failures is another reason why

222
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:30,870
failures is another reason why
 

223
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:50,219
failures is another reason why
distributed systems are hard and a final

224
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:50,229
distributed systems are hard and a final
 

225
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:51,870
distributed systems are hard and a final
reason why it's hard is that you know

226
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:51,880
reason why it's hard is that you know
 

227
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,279
reason why it's hard is that you know
them the original reason to build the

228
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:53,289
them the original reason to build the
 

229
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:54,770
them the original reason to build the
distributed system is often to get

230
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:54,780
distributed system is often to get
 

231
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,600
distributed system is often to get
higher performance to get you know a

232
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:57,610
higher performance to get you know a
 

233
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,370
higher performance to get you know a
thousand computers worth of performance

234
00:04:59,370 --> 00:04:59,380
thousand computers worth of performance
 

235
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,649
thousand computers worth of performance
or a thousand disk arms were the

236
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:01,659
or a thousand disk arms were the
 

237
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:03,570
or a thousand disk arms were the
performance but it's actually very

238
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:03,580
performance but it's actually very
 

239
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,810
performance but it's actually very
tricky to obtain that thousand X speed

240
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:06,820
tricky to obtain that thousand X speed
 

241
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,300
tricky to obtain that thousand X speed
up with a thousand computers there's

242
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:09,310
up with a thousand computers there's
 

243
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,000
up with a thousand computers there's
often a lot of roadblocks thrown in your

244
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,010
often a lot of roadblocks thrown in your
 

245
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:20,070
often a lot of roadblocks thrown in your
way so the Elven takes a bit of careful

246
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
way so the Elven takes a bit of careful
 

247
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,950
way so the Elven takes a bit of careful
design to make the system actually give

248
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
design to make the system actually give
 

249
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,260
design to make the system actually give
you the performance you feel you deserve

250
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,270
you the performance you feel you deserve
 

251
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,430
you the performance you feel you deserve
so solving these problems of course

252
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:26,440
so solving these problems of course
 

253
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,680
so solving these problems of course
going to be all about you know

254
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:27,690
going to be all about you know
 

255
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,950
going to be all about you know
addressing these issues the reason to

256
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:31,960
addressing these issues the reason to
 

257
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,719
addressing these issues the reason to
take the course is because often the

258
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:33,729
take the course is because often the
 

259
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:35,399
take the course is because often the
problems and the solutions are quite

260
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:35,409
problems and the solutions are quite
 

261
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:38,310
problems and the solutions are quite
just technically interesting they're

262
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
just technically interesting they're
 

263
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
just technically interesting they're
hard problems for some of these problems

264
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,330
hard problems for some of these problems
 

265
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,630
hard problems for some of these problems
there's pretty good solutions known for

266
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:42,640
there's pretty good solutions known for
 

267
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,490
there's pretty good solutions known for
other problems they're not such great

268
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:44,500
other problems they're not such great
 

269
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,730
other problems they're not such great
solutions now distributed systems are

270
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:47,740
solutions now distributed systems are
 

271
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,909
solutions now distributed systems are
used by a lot of real-world systems out

00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:03,490
this course it was distributed systems
 

283
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,219
this course it was distributed systems
were something of an academic curiosity

seriously important part of computing
 

305
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:32,879
seriously important part of computing
infrastructure this means that there's

306
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:32,889
infrastructure this means that there's
 

307
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:34,469
infrastructure this means that there's
been a lot of attention paid to them a

308
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
been a lot of attention paid to them a
 

309
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,240
been a lot of attention paid to them a
lot of problems have been solved but

310
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,250
lot of problems have been solved but
 

311
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,680
lot of problems have been solved but
there's still quite a few unsolved

312
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:37,690
there's still quite a few unsolved
 

313
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,930
there's still quite a few unsolved
problems so if you're a graduate student

314
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:39,940
problems so if you're a graduate student
 

315
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,480
problems so if you're a graduate student
or you're interested in research there's

316
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:42,490
or you're interested in research there's
 

317
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,300
or you're interested in research there's
a lot to you let a lot of problems yet

318
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:45,310
a lot to you let a lot of problems yet
 

319
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,279
a lot to you let a lot of problems yet
to be solved in distributed systems that

320
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:47,289
to be solved in distributed systems that
 

321
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:49,710
to be solved in distributed systems that
you could look into his research and

you could look into his research and
 

323
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,629
you could look into his research and
finally if you like building stuff this

is a good class because it has a lab
sequence in which you'll construct some

328
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,050
sequence in which you'll construct some
 

329
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,680
sequence in which you'll construct some
fairly realistic distributed systems

330
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:58,690

to do with actual construction of of
 

459
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,420
to do with actual construction of of
software based systems and we're also

460

software based systems and we're also
 

461
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,890
software based systems and we're also
going to spend a certain time looking at

the content of the paper and have a sort
 

485
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
the content of the paper and have a sort
of interesting reflection on what the

486
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:32,830
of interesting reflection on what the
 

487
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,040
of interesting reflection on what the
paper means online class so you really

488
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,050
paper means online class so you really
 

489
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,199
paper means online class so you really
got to read the papers before I come

490
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:37,209
got to read the papers before I come
 

491
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:38,610
got to read the papers before I come
into class and hopefully one of the

492
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:38,620
into class and hopefully one of the
 

493
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,020
into class and hopefully one of the
things you'll learn in this class is how

494
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,030
things you'll learn in this class is how
 

495
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,460
things you'll learn in this class is how
to read a paper rapidly in the fish

496
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:42,470
to read a paper rapidly in the fish
 

497
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,930
to read a paper rapidly in the fish
and skip over the parts that maybe

498
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:44,940
and skip over the parts that maybe
 

499
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,420
and skip over the parts that maybe
aren't that important and sort of focus

500
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:47,430
aren't that important and sort of focus
 

501
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,350
aren't that important and sort of focus

00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:32,630
class I think on the last class meeting
before spring break and there's a final

00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
before spring break and there's a final
 

535
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,990
before spring break and there's a final
exam during final exam week at the end

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
exam during final exam week at the end
 

537
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,760
exam during final exam week at the end
of the semester the exams are going to

538
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:37,770
of the semester the exams are going to
 

539
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,110
of the semester the exams are going to
focus mostly on papers and the labs and

540
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,120
focus mostly on papers and the labs and
 

541
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,120
focus mostly on papers and the labs and
probably the best way to prepare for

542
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,130
probably the best way to prepare for
 

543
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,310
probably the best way to prepare for
them as well as attending lecture and

544
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
them as well as attending lecture and
 

545
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,220
them as well as attending lecture and
reading the papers a good way to prepare

546
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:49,230
reading the papers a good way to prepare
 

547
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,350
reading the papers a good way to prepare
for the exams is to look at all exams we

548
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
for the exams is to look at all exams we
 

549
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,670
for the exams is to look at all exams we
have links to 20 years of old exams and

550
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680
have links to 20 years of old exams and
 

551
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,230
have links to 20 years of old exams and
solutions and so you look at those and

552
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:57,240
solutions and so you look at those and
 

553
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,700
solutions and so you look at those and
sort of get a feel for what kind of

554
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:58,710
sort of get a feel for what kind of
 

555
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,340
sort of get a feel for what kind of
questions that I like to ask and indeed

556
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:01,350
questions that I like to ask and indeed
 

557
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,160
questions that I like to ask and indeed
because we read many of the same papers

558
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,170
because we read many of the same papers
 

559
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,540
because we read many of the same papers
inevitably I ask questions each year

560
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:05,550
inevitably I ask questions each year
 

561
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,900
inevitably I ask questions each year
that can't help but resemble questions

562

00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:23,700
idea for a distributed system you know
 

643
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,000
idea for a distributed system you know
in the style of some of the distributed

644
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,010
in the style of some of the distributed
 

645
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,320
in the style of some of the distributed
systems we talked about in the class if

646
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,330
systems we talked about in the class if
 

647
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,520
systems we talked about in the class if
you have your own idea that you want to

648
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:28,530
you have your own idea that you want to
 

649
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,290
you have your own idea that you want to
pursue and you like to build something

650
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:30,300
pursue and you like to build something
 

651
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,090
pursue and you like to build something
and measure whether it worked in order

652
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:32,100
and measure whether it worked in order
 

653
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,490
and measure whether it worked in order
to explore your idea you can do a

654
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:34,500
to explore your idea you can do a
 

655
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,360
to explore your idea you can do a
project and so for a project you'll pick

656
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:38,370
project and so for a project you'll pick
 

657
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,160
project and so for a project you'll pick
some teammates because we require that

658
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,170
some teammates because we require that
 

659
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,060
some teammates because we require that
projects are done in teams of two or

660
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,070
projects are done in teams of two or
 

661
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,420
projects are done in teams of two or
three people so like some teammates and

662
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:47,430
three people so like some teammates and
 

663
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,040
three people so like some teammates and
send your project idea to us and we'll

664
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,050
send your project idea to us and we'll
 

665
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,930
send your project idea to us and we'll
think about it and say yes or no and

666
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:50,940
think about it and say yes or no and
 

667
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,570
think about it and say yes or no and
maybe give you some advice and then if

668
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:53,580
maybe give you some advice and then if
 

669
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,220
maybe give you some advice and then if
you go ahead and do if we say yes and

670
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:55,230
you go ahead and do if we say yes and
 

671
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,600
you go ahead and do if we say yes and
you want to do a project you do that and

672
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:56,610
you want to do a project you do that and
 

673
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,150
you want to do a project you do that and
instead of lab 4 and it's due at the end

674
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,160
instead of lab 4 and it's due at the end
 

675
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,860
instead of lab 4 and it's due at the end
of the semester and you know you'll you

676
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:00,870
of the semester and you know you'll you
 

677
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:05,240
of the semester and you know you'll you
should do some design work and build a

678
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,250
should do some design work and build a
 

679
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,950
should do some design work and build a
real system and then in the last day of

680
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:06,960
real system and then in the last day of
 

681
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,930
real system and then in the last day of
class you'll demonstrate your system

682
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:08,940
class you'll demonstrate your system
 

683
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,360
class you'll demonstrate your system
as well as handing in a short sort of

684
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:11,370
as well as handing in a short sort of
 

685
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,890
as well as handing in a short sort of
written report to us about what you

686
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:12,900
written report to us about what you
 

687
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,720
written report to us about what you
built and I posted on the website some

688
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:17,730
built and I posted on the website some
 

689
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,060
built and I posted on the website some
some ideas which might or may not be

690
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,070
some ideas which might or may not be
 

691
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,340
some ideas which might or may not be
useful for you to sort of spur thoughts

692
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:22,350
useful for you to sort of spur thoughts
 

693
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,130
useful for you to sort of spur thoughts
about what projects you might build but

694
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:25,140
about what projects you might build but
 

695
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,680
about what projects you might build but
really the best projects are one where

696
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:27,690
really the best projects are one where
 

697
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,080
really the best projects are one where
sort of you have a good idea for the

698
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,090
sort of you have a good idea for the
 

699
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,690
sort of you have a good idea for the
project and the idea is if you want to

700
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:32,700
project and the idea is if you want to
 

701
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,910
project and the idea is if you want to
do a project you should choose an idea

702
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:34,920
do a project you should choose an idea
 

703
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,800
do a project you should choose an idea
that's sort of in the same vein as the

704
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:36,810
that's sort of in the same vein as the
 

705
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,140
that's sort of in the same vein as the
systems that were talked about in this

706
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,150
systems that were talked about in this
 

707
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,630
systems that were talked about in this
class

708
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:40,640
class
 

709
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,030
class
okay back to labs the lab Greed's they

710
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,040
okay back to labs the lab Greed's they
 

711
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,010
okay back to labs the lab Greed's they
we give you you hand in your lab code

712
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:46,020
we give you you hand in your lab code
 

713
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,930
we give you you hand in your lab code
and we run some tests against it and

714
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:47,940
and we run some tests against it and
 

715
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,700
and we run some tests against it and
you're great early based on how many

716
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:49,710
you're great early based on how many
 

717
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,860
you're great early based on how many
tests you pass we give you all the tests

718
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:51,870
tests you pass we give you all the tests
 

719
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,160
tests you pass we give you all the tests
that we use those no hidden tests so if

720
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,170
that we use those no hidden tests so if
 

721
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,840
that we use those no hidden tests so if
you implement the lab and it reliably

722
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:56,850
you implement the lab and it reliably
 

723
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,940
you implement the lab and it reliably
passes all the tests and chances are

724
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:58,950
passes all the tests and chances are
 

725
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,740
passes all the tests and chances are
good unless there's something funny

726
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:00,750
good unless there's something funny
 

727
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,300
good unless there's something funny
going on which there sometimes is

728
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:02,310
going on which there sometimes is
 

729
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,640
going on which there sometimes is
chances are good that if you your coop

730
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:04,650
chances are good that if you your coop
 

731
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,050
chances are good that if you your coop
passes all the tests when you run it or

732
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:06,060
passes all the tests when you run it or
 

733
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,550
passes all the tests when you run it or
pass all the tests when we run it and

734
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:07,560
pass all the tests when we run it and
 

735
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,310
pass all the tests when we run it and
you'll get a four score full score so

736
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
you'll get a four score full score so
 

737
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,510
you'll get a four score full score so
hopefully there'll be no mystery about

738
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:11,520
hopefully there'll be no mystery about
 

739
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,820
hopefully there'll be no mystery about
what score you're likely to get on the

740
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:13,830
what score you're likely to get on the
 

741
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:18,770
what score you're likely to get on the
labs let me warn you that debugging

742
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:18,780
labs let me warn you that debugging
 

743
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,920
labs let me warn you that debugging
these labs can be time-consuming because

744
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:21,930
these labs can be time-consuming because
 

745
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,540
these labs can be time-consuming because
they're distributed systems and a lot of

746
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:23,550
they're distributed systems and a lot of
 

747
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,810
they're distributed systems and a lot of
concurrency and communication sort of

748
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:26,820
concurrency and communication sort of
 

749
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,990
concurrency and communication sort of
strange difficult to debug errors can

750
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
strange difficult to debug errors can
 

751
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,010
strange difficult to debug errors can
crop up so you really ought to start the

752
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,020
crop up so you really ought to start the
 

753
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,370
crop up so you really ought to start the
labs early don't don't even have a lot

754
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:37,380
labs early don't don't even have a lot
 

755
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,200
labs early don't don't even have a lot
of trouble if you be elapsed to the last

756
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,210
of trouble if you be elapsed to the last
 

757
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,360
of trouble if you be elapsed to the last
moment you got to start early if your

758
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:41,370
moment you got to start early if your
 

759
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,670
moment you got to start early if your
problems please come to the TAS office

760
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:43,680
problems please come to the TAS office
 

761
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,770
problems please come to the TAS office
hours and please feel free to ask

762
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:45,780
hours and please feel free to ask
 

763
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,070
hours and please feel free to ask
questions about the labs on Piazza and

764
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:49,080
questions about the labs on Piazza and
 

765
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,260
questions about the labs on Piazza and
indeed I hope if you know the answer

766
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:51,270
indeed I hope if you know the answer
 

767
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,760
indeed I hope if you know the answer
that you'll answer people's questions on

768
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:52,770
that you'll answer people's questions on
 

769
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,329
that you'll answer people's questions on
Piazza as well all right any questions

770
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:56,339
Piazza as well all right any questions
 

771
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:10,329
Piazza as well all right any questions
about the mechanics of the course yes

772
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:10,339

 

773
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:13,130

so the question is what is how does how

774
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:13,140
so the question is what is how does how
 

775
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,319
so the question is what is how does how
do the different factor these things

776
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:15,329
do the different factor these things
 

777
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:17,540
do the different factor these things
factoring the grade I forget but it's

778
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:17,550
factoring the grade I forget but it's
 

779
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,170
factoring the grade I forget but it's
all on the it's on the website under

780
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:20,180
all on the it's on the website under
 

781
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,890
all on the it's on the website under
something I think though it's the labs

782
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:24,900
something I think though it's the labs
 

783
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,560
something I think though it's the labs
are the single most important component

784
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:29,570
are the single most important component
 

785
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:36,340
are the single most important component
okay alright so this is a course about

786
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:36,350
okay alright so this is a course about
 

787
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,770
okay alright so this is a course about
about infrastructure for applications

788
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:39,780
about infrastructure for applications
 

789
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,450
about infrastructure for applications
and so all through this course there's

790
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:41,460
and so all through this course there's
 

791
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,799
and so all through this course there's
going to be a sort of split in the way I

792
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:42,809
going to be a sort of split in the way I
 

793
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:45,169
going to be a sort of split in the way I
talk about things between applications

794
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:45,179
talk about things between applications
 

795
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,540
talk about things between applications
which are sort of other people the

796
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:47,550
which are sort of other people the
 

797
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,970
which are sort of other people the
customer somebody else writes but the

798
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:49,980

799
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,380
customer somebody else writes but the
applications are going to use the

800
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:51,390
applications are going to use the
 

801
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,150
applications are going to use the
infrastructure that we're thinking about

802
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:53,160
infrastructure that we're thinking about
 

803
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,730
infrastructure that we're thinking about
in this course and so the kinds of

804
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:55,740
in this course and so the kinds of
 

805
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,940
in this course and so the kinds of
infrastructure that tend to come up a

806
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:58,950
infrastructure that tend to come up a
 

807
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:13,610
infrastructure that tend to come up a
lot our storage communication and

808
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:13,620
lot our storage communication and
 

809
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,910
lot our storage communication and
computation and we'll talk about systems

810
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:16,920
computation and we'll talk about systems
 

811
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,040
computation and we'll talk about systems
that provide all three of these kinds of

812
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,050
that provide all three of these kinds of
 

813
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:23,360
that provide all three of these kinds of
infrastructure the the storage it turns

814
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:23,370
infrastructure the the storage it turns
 

815
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,890
infrastructure the the storage it turns
out that storage is going to be the one

816
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:24,900
out that storage is going to be the one
 

817
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,980
out that storage is going to be the one
we focus most on because it's a very

818
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:27,990
we focus most on because it's a very
 

819
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,970
we focus most on because it's a very
well-defined and useful abstraction and

820
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:30,980
well-defined and useful abstraction and
 

821
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,810
well-defined and useful abstraction and
usually fairly straightforward

822
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:32,820
usually fairly straightforward
 

823
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,310
usually fairly straightforward
abstraction so people know a lot about

824
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320
abstraction so people know a lot about
 

825
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,220
abstraction so people know a lot about
how to build how to use and build

826
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,230

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:40,350
storage systems and how to build sort of
 

829
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,660

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:46,410
implementations of storage we'll also
 

835
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,710

839
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,740
systems like MapReduce for today is a
computation system and we will talk

840
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:54,750
computation system and we will talk
 

841
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,110
computation system and we will talk
about communications some but mostly

842
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,120
about communications some but mostly
 

843
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,700
about communications some but mostly
from the point is a tool that we need to

844
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:58,710
from the point is a tool that we need to
 

845
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,500
from the point is a tool that we need to
use to build distributed systems like

846
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:00,510
use to build distributed systems like
 

847
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,970
use to build distributed systems like
computers have to talk to each other

848
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:01,980
computers have to talk to each other
 

849
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,740
computers have to talk to each other
over a network you know maybe you need

850
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:03,750
over a network you know maybe you need
 

851
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,320
over a network you know maybe you need
reliability or something and so we'll

852
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,330
reliability or something and so we'll
 

853
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,660
reliability or something and so we'll
talk a bit about what we're actually

854
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:08,670
talk a bit about what we're actually
 

855
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:11,960
talk a bit about what we're actually
mostly consumers of communication if you

856
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:11,970
mostly consumers of communication if you
 

857
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,970
mostly consumers of communication if you
want to learn about communication

858
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:12,980
want to learn about communication
 

859
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,030

systems as sort of how they work that's

860
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,040
systems as sort of how they work that's
 

861
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,770
systems as sort of how they work that's
more the topic of six eight to nine

00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:20,780
more the topic of six eight to nine
 

863
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,740
more the topic of six eight to nine
so for storage and computation a lot of

864
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:24,750
so for storage and computation a lot of
 

865
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,190
so for storage and computation a lot of

the interface to these two storage and

870
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:34,440
the interface to these two storage and
 

871
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,650
the interface to these two storage and
computation distributed storage and

872
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:36,660
computation distributed storage and
 

873
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,750
computation distributed storage and
computation infrastructure so that it's

874
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:38,760
computation infrastructure so that it's
 

875
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,850
computation infrastructure so that it's
easy to build applications on top of it

876
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:40,860
easy to build applications on top of it
 

877
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,490
easy to build applications on top of it
and what that really means is that we

878
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:43,500
and what that really means is that we
 

879
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,260
and what that really means is that we
need to we'd like to be able to build

abstraction that hide the distributed
 

883
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,230
abstraction that hide the distributed
nature of these of these systems so the

884
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:51,240
nature of these of these systems so the
 

885
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,290
nature of these of these systems so the
dream which is rarely fully achieved but

886
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:54,300
dream which is rarely fully achieved but
 

887
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,570
dream which is rarely fully achieved but
the dream would be to be able to build

888
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:56,580
the dream would be to be able to build
 

889
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,700
the dream would be to be able to build
an interface that looks to an

00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:58,710
an interface that looks to an
 

891
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,620
an interface that looks to an
application is if it's a non distributed

892
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:00,630

storage system just like a file system

894
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:02,310
storage system just like a file system
 

895
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,740
storage system just like a file system
or something that everybody already

896
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:03,750
or something that everybody already
 

897
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,270
or something that everybody already
knows how to program and has a pretty

simple model semantics we'd love to be

900
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:08,100

901
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,980
simple model semantics we'd love to be
able to build interfaces that look and

902
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:09,990
able to build interfaces that look and
 

903
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,760
able to build interfaces that look and
act just like non distributed storage

904
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:13,770
act just like non distributed storage
 

905
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,590
act just like non distributed storage
and computation systems but are actually

906
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:17,600
and computation systems but are actually
 

907
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,360
and computation systems but are actually
you know vast extremely high performance

908
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:20,370
you know vast extremely high performance
 

909
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,580
you know vast extremely high performance
fault tolerant distributed systems

910
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:22,590
fault tolerant distributed systems
 

911
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:30,010
fault tolerant distributed systems
underneath so we both have abstractions

912
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:30,020

 

913
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,020

and you know as you'll see as a course

914
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,030
and you know as you'll see as a course
 

915
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:37,940
and you know as you'll see as a course
goes on we sort of you know only part of

916
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:37,950
goes on we sort of you know only part of
 

917
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,800
goes on we sort of you know only part of
the way there it's rare that you find an

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:44,730
storage or computation that has simple
 

923
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:49,100
storage or computation that has simple
behavior but he's just like the non just

924
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,110
behavior but he's just like the non just
 

925
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,110

non distributed version of storage that

926
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,120
non distributed version of storage that
 

927
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,910
non distributed version of storage that
everybody understands but people getting

00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:52,920
everybody understands but people getting
 

929
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:59,630
everybody understands but people getting
better at this and we're gonna try to

930
00:20:59,630 --> 00:20:59,640
better at this and we're gonna try to
 

931
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,670
better at this and we're gonna try to
study the ways and what people have

932
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:01,680
study the ways and what people have
 

933
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,850
study the ways and what people have
learned about building such abstractions

934
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:03,860
learned about building such abstractions
 

935
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,750
learned about building such abstractions
ok so what kind of what kind of topics

936
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:08,760
ok so what kind of what kind of topics
 

937
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,160
ok so what kind of what kind of topics
show up is we're considering these

topic that we'll see a lot is threads

962
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,230
topic that we'll see a lot is threads
 

963
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,930
topic that we'll see a lot is threads
which are a programming technique that

964
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:51,940
which are a programming technique that
 

965
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,019
which are a programming technique that
allows us to harness what allows us to

966
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:55,029
allows us to harness what allows us to
 

967
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:56,850
allows us to harness what allows us to
harness multi-core computers but maybe

968
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:56,860
harness multi-core computers but maybe
 

969
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,739
harness multi-core computers but maybe
more important for this class threads

970
00:21:58,739 --> 00:21:58,749
more important for this class threads
 

971
00:21:58,749 --> 00:22:00,299
more important for this class threads
are a way of structuring concurrent

972
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:00,309
are a way of structuring concurrent
 

973
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:03,090
are a way of structuring concurrent
operations in a way that's hopefully

974
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:03,100
operations in a way that's hopefully
 

975
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,269
operations in a way that's hopefully
simplifies the programmer view of those

976
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:06,279
simplifies the programmer view of those
 

977
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:09,090
simplifies the programmer view of those
concurrent operations and because we're

978
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:09,100
concurrent operations and because we're
 

979
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,320
concurrent operations and because we're
gonna use threads a lot it turns out

980
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,330
gonna use threads a lot it turns out
 

981
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,269
gonna use threads a lot it turns out
we're going to need to also you know

982
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:12,279
we're going to need to also you know
 

983
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,769
we're going to need to also you know
just as from an implementation level

984
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:13,779
just as from an implementation level
 

985
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:15,149
just as from an implementation level
spend a certain amount of time thinking

986
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:15,159
spend a certain amount of time thinking
 

987
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:16,830
spend a certain amount of time thinking
about concurrency control things like

988
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:16,840
about concurrency control things like
 

989
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:25,169
about concurrency control things like
locks and the main place that these

990
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:25,179
locks and the main place that these
 

991
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:26,580
locks and the main place that these
implementation ideas will come up in the

992
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:26,590
implementation ideas will come up in the
 

993
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,590
implementation ideas will come up in the
class they'll be touched on in many of

994
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:28,600
class they'll be touched on in many of
 

995
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,180
class they'll be touched on in many of
the papers but you're gonna come face

996
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:30,190
the papers but you're gonna come face
 

997
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,859
the papers but you're gonna come face
the face of all this in a big way in the

998
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:31,869
the face of all this in a big way in the
 

999
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:34,200
the face of all this in a big way in the
labs you need to build distributed you

1000
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,210
labs you need to build distributed you
 

1001
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,700
labs you need to build distributed you
know do the programming for distributed

1002
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:35,710
know do the programming for distributed
 

1003
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,070
know do the programming for distributed
system and these are like a lot of sort

1004
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,080
system and these are like a lot of sort
 

1005
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,070
system and these are like a lot of sort
of important tools you know beyond just

1006
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:41,080
of important tools you know beyond just
 

1007
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,649
of important tools you know beyond just
sort of ordinary programming these are

1008
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:43,659
sort of ordinary programming these are
 

1009
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:44,999
sort of ordinary programming these are
some of the critical tools that you'll

1010
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:45,009
some of the critical tools that you'll
 

1011
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:50,269
some of the critical tools that you'll
need to use to build distributed systems

1012
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:50,279
need to use to build distributed systems
 

1013
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,119
need to use to build distributed systems
another big topic that comes up in all

1014
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:54,129
another big topic that comes up in all
 

1015
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:55,379
another big topic that comes up in all
the papers we're going to talk about is

1016
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:55,389
the papers we're going to talk about is
 

1017
00:22:55,389 --> 00:23:05,430
the papers we're going to talk about is
performance usually the high-level goal

1018
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:05,440
performance usually the high-level goal
 

1019
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,560
performance usually the high-level goal
of building a distributed system is to

1020
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:07,570
of building a distributed system is to
 

1021
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,840
of building a distributed system is to
get what people call scalable speed-up

1022
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:11,850
get what people call scalable speed-up
 

1023
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:17,450
get what people call scalable speed-up
so we're looking for scalability and

1024
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:17,460
so we're looking for scalability and
 

1025
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,029
so we're looking for scalability and
what I mean by scalability or scalable

1026
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
what I mean by scalability or scalable
 

1027
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,519
what I mean by scalability or scalable
speed-up is that if I have some problem

1028
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:23,529
speed-up is that if I have some problem
 

1029
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:26,100
speed-up is that if I have some problem
that I'm solving with one computer and I

1030
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,110
that I'm solving with one computer and I
 

1031
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,549
that I'm solving with one computer and I
buy a second computer to help me execute

1032
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:29,559
buy a second computer to help me execute
 

1033
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,769
buy a second computer to help me execute
my problem if I can now solve the

1034
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:31,779
my problem if I can now solve the
 

1035
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:34,080
my problem if I can now solve the
problem in half the time or maybe solve

1036
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,090
problem in half the time or maybe solve
 

1037
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,440
problem in half the time or maybe solve
twice as many problem instances you know

1038
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:37,450
twice as many problem instances you know
 

1039
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,840
twice as many problem instances you know
per minute on two computers as I had on

1040
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:39,850
per minute on two computers as I had on
 

1041
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,330
per minute on two computers as I had on
one then that's an example of

1042
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:42,340
one then that's an example of
 

1043
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,310
one then that's an example of
scalability so

1044
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,320
scalability so
 

1045
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,550
scalability so
sort of two times you know computers or

1046
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:47,560
sort of two times you know computers or
 

1047
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:54,080
sort of two times you know computers or
resources gets me you know two times

1048
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,090
resources gets me you know two times
 

1049
00:23:54,090 --> 00:24:01,080
resources gets me you know two times
performance or throughput and this is a

1050
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,090
performance or throughput and this is a
 

1051
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,910
performance or throughput and this is a
huge hammer if you can build a system

1052
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:02,920
huge hammer if you can build a system
 

1053
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,160
huge hammer if you can build a system
that actually has this behavior Namie

1054
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,170
that actually has this behavior Namie
 

1055
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,320
that actually has this behavior Namie
that if you increase the number of

1056
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:07,330
that if you increase the number of
 

1057
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,820
that if you increase the number of
computers you throw at the problem by

1058
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:08,830
computers you throw at the problem by
 

1059
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,180
computers you throw at the problem by
some factor you get that factor more

1060
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:12,190
some factor you get that factor more
 

1061
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,640
some factor you get that factor more
throughput more performance out of the

1062
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:14,650
throughput more performance out of the
 

1063
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:17,880
throughput more performance out of the
system that's a huge win because you can

1064
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:17,890
system that's a huge win because you can
 

1065
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,000
system that's a huge win because you can
buy computers with just money right

1066
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,010
buy computers with just money right
 

1067
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,400
buy computers with just money right
whereas if in order to get the

1068
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:23,410
whereas if in order to get the
 

1069
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,030
whereas if in order to get the
alternative to this is that in order to

1070
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,040
alternative to this is that in order to
 

1071
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,620
alternative to this is that in order to
get more performance you have to pay

1072
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:28,630
get more performance you have to pay
 

1073
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,370
get more performance you have to pay
programmers to restructure your software

1074
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:31,380
programmers to restructure your software
 

1075
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,540
programmers to restructure your software
to get better performance to make it

1076
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:33,550
to get better performance to make it
 

1077
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,910
to get better performance to make it
more efficient or to apply some sort of

1078
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:35,920
more efficient or to apply some sort of
 

1079
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,890
more efficient or to apply some sort of
specialized techniques better algorithms

1080
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:37,900
specialized techniques better algorithms
 

1081
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,960
specialized techniques better algorithms
or something if you have to pay

1082
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:39,970
or something if you have to pay
 

1083
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,930
or something if you have to pay
programmers to fix your code to be

1084
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:42,940
programmers to fix your code to be
 

1085
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,450
programmers to fix your code to be
faster that's an expensive way to go

1086
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:45,460
faster that's an expensive way to go
 

1087
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,580
faster that's an expensive way to go
we'd love to be able just oh by thousand

1088
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:47,590
we'd love to be able just oh by thousand
 

1089
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,680
we'd love to be able just oh by thousand
computers instead of ten computers and

1090
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:49,690
computers instead of ten computers and
 

1091
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,600
computers instead of ten computers and
get a hundred times more throughput

1092
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:51,610
get a hundred times more throughput
 

1093
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,730
get a hundred times more throughput
that's fantastic and so this sort of

1094
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:53,740
that's fantastic and so this sort of
 

1095
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,820
that's fantastic and so this sort of
scalability idea is a huge idea in the

1096
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:56,830
scalability idea is a huge idea in the
 

1097
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,050
scalability idea is a huge idea in the
backs of people's heads when they're

1098
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:58,060
backs of people's heads when they're
 

1099
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,550
backs of people's heads when they're
like building things like big websites

1100
00:24:59,550 --> 00:24:59,560
like building things like big websites
 

1101
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,590
like building things like big websites
that run on are you know building full

1102
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:01,600
that run on are you know building full
 

1103
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,500
that run on are you know building full
of computers if the building full of

1104
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:04,510
of computers if the building full of
 

1105
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,660
of computers if the building full of
computers is there to get a sort of

1106
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:06,670
computers is there to get a sort of
 

1107
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,600
computers is there to get a sort of
corresponding amount of performance but

1108
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:09,610
corresponding amount of performance but
 

1109
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,030
corresponding amount of performance but
you have to be careful about the design

1110
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:12,040
you have to be careful about the design
 

1111
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,440
you have to be careful about the design
in order to actually get that

1112
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:13,450
in order to actually get that
 

1113
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:19,770
in order to actually get that
performance so often the way this looks

1114
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:19,780
performance so often the way this looks
 

1115
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,900
performance so often the way this looks
when we're looking at diagrams or I'm

1116
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:21,910

1117
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,520
when we're looking at diagrams or I'm
writing diagrams in this course is that

1118
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:23,530
writing diagrams in this course is that
 

1119
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,470
writing diagrams in this course is that
I'm not supposing we're building a

1125
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,890

let's say it has some types of users

you know when you have one or two users
 

1137
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,610
you know when you have one or two users
you can just have one computer running

1138
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:58,620
you can just have one computer running
 

1139
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,710
you can just have one computer running
both and maybe a computer for the web

labor-intensive optimization but you
 

1159
00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:27,769
labor-intensive optimization but you
don't have time for so typically the way

1160
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:27,779
don't have time for so typically the way
 

1161
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:29,509
don't have time for so typically the way
you're going to speed things up the

1162
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:29,519
you're going to speed things up the
 

1163
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,100
you're going to speed things up the
first thing you do is buy more web

1164
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,110
first thing you do is buy more web
 

1165
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,529
first thing you do is buy more web
servers and just split the user so that

1166
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:33,539
servers and just split the user so that
 

1167
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,570
servers and just split the user so that
you know how few users or some fraction

1168
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:35,580
you know how few users or some fraction
 

1169
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,220
you know how few users or some fraction
the user go to a web server 1 and the

1170
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:37,230
the user go to a web server 1 and the
 

1171
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,740
the user go to a web server 1 and the
other half you send them to a web server

1172
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:39,750
other half you send them to a web server
 

1173
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:45,950
other half you send them to a web server
2 and because maybe you're building I

1174
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:45,960
2 and because maybe you're building I
 

1175
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,749
2 and because maybe you're building I
don't know what reddit or something

1176
00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:47,759
don't know what reddit or something
 

1177
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:49,430
don't know what reddit or something
where all the users need to see the same

1178
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:49,440
where all the users need to see the same
 

1179
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,200
where all the users need to see the same
data ultimately you have all the web

1180
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,210
data ultimately you have all the web
 

1181
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,019
data ultimately you have all the web
servers talk to the backend and you can

1182
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:54,029
servers talk to the backend and you can
 

1183
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,549
servers talk to the backend and you can
keep on adding web servers for a long

1184
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:55,559
keep on adding web servers for a long
 

1185
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:01,669
keep on adding web servers for a long
time here and so this is a way of

1186
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:01,679
time here and so this is a way of
 

1187
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,019
time here and so this is a way of
getting parallel speed up on the web

1188
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:03,029
getting parallel speed up on the web
 

1189
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:04,249
getting parallel speed up on the web
server code you know if you're running

1190
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:04,259
server code you know if you're running
 

1191
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:05,899
server code you know if you're running
PHP or Python maybe it's not too

1192
00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:05,909
PHP or Python maybe it's not too
 

1193
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:09,560
PHP or Python maybe it's not too
efficient as long as each individual web

1194
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:09,570
efficient as long as each individual web
 

1195
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,480
efficient as long as each individual web
server doesn't put too much load on the

1196
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:11,490
server doesn't put too much load on the
 

1197
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,830
server doesn't put too much load on the
database you can add a lot of web

1198
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:12,840
database you can add a lot of web
 

1199
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,690
database you can add a lot of web
servers before you run into problems but

1200
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:17,700
servers before you run into problems but
 

1201
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,659
servers before you run into problems but
this kind of scalability is rarely

1202
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:20,669
this kind of scalability is rarely
 

1203
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:23,600
this kind of scalability is rarely
infinite unfortunately certainly not

1204
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:23,610
infinite unfortunately certainly not
 

1205
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,279
infinite unfortunately certainly not
without serious thought and so what

1206
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:25,289
without serious thought and so what
 

1207
00:27:25,289 --> 00:27:26,690
without serious thought and so what
tends to happen with these systems is

1208
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:26,700
tends to happen with these systems is
 

1209
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,299
tends to happen with these systems is
that at some point after you have 10 or

1210
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:29,309
that at some point after you have 10 or
 

1211
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:31,369
that at some point after you have 10 or
20 or 100 web servers all talking to the

1212
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:31,379
20 or 100 web servers all talking to the
 

1213
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:33,440
20 or 100 web servers all talking to the
same database now all of a sudden the

1214
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:33,450
same database now all of a sudden the
 

1215
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,090
same database now all of a sudden the
database starts to be a bottleneck and

1216
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:35,100
database starts to be a bottleneck and
 

1217
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,039
database starts to be a bottleneck and
adding more web servers no longer helps

1218
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:37,049
adding more web servers no longer helps
 

1219
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:38,899
adding more web servers no longer helps
so it's rare that you get full scale

1220
00:27:38,899 --> 00:27:38,909
so it's rare that you get full scale
 

1221
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:42,700
so it's rare that you get full scale
ability to sort of infinite numbers of

ability to sort of infinite numbers of
 

1223
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,840
ability to sort of infinite numbers of
adding infinite numbers of computers

1224
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:44,850
adding infinite numbers of computers
 

1225
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,700
adding infinite numbers of computers
some point you run out of gas because

1226
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:46,710
some point you run out of gas because
 

1227
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,590
some point you run out of gas because
the place at which you are adding more

the place at which you are adding more
 

1229
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,409
the place at which you are adding more
computers is no longer the bottleneck by

computers is no longer the bottleneck by
 

1231
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,730
computers is no longer the bottleneck by
having lots and lots of web servers we

1232
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:52,740
having lots and lots of web servers we
 

1233
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,259
having lots and lots of web servers we
basically moved the bottleneck

1234
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:54,269
basically moved the bottleneck
 

1235
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:56,539
basically moved the bottleneck
I think it's limiting performance from

00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:56,549
I think it's limiting performance from
 

1237
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:01,639
I think it's limiting performance from
the web servers to the database and at

00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:01,649
the web servers to the database and at
 

1239
00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:03,440
the web servers to the database and at
this point actually you almost certainly

this point actually you almost certainly
 

1241
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,720
this point actually you almost certainly
have to do a bit of design work because

have to do a bit of design work because
 

1243
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,580
have to do a bit of design work because
it's rare that you can

00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,919
it's rare that you can
there's any straightforward way to take

1246
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:09,929
there's any straightforward way to take
 

1247
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:13,399
there's any straightforward way to take
a single database and sort of refactor

1248
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:13,409
a single database and sort of refactor
 

1249
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:17,450
a single database and sort of refactor
things with it or you can take data

1250
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:17,460
things with it or you can take data
 

1251
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,340
things with it or you can take data
sorta in a single database and refactor

1252
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:19,350
sorta in a single database and refactor
 

1253
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:23,830
sorta in a single database and refactor
it so it's split over multiple databases

1254
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:23,840

 

1255
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,830

but it's often a fair amount of work and

but it's often a fair amount of work and
 

1257
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,299

00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:42,659
you know something like a big website

00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:45,799
you know something like a big website

that ran out of gas on a single database
 

1273
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:49,419
that ran out of gas on a single database
or storage servers anyway so the

1274
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:49,429
or storage servers anyway so the
 

1275
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:51,590

scalability story is we love to build

1276
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:51,600
scalability story is we love to build
 

1277
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,320
scalability story is we love to build
systems that scale this way but you know

1278
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:56,330
systems that scale this way but you know
 

1279
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,090
systems that scale this way but you know
it's hard to make it or takes work off

1280
00:28:59,090 --> 00:28:59,100
it's hard to make it or takes work off
 

1281
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,940
it's hard to make it or takes work off
and design work to push this idea

1282
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:01,950
and design work to push this idea
 

1283
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:11,869
and design work to push this idea
infinitely far ok so another big topic

1284
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:11,879
infinitely far ok so another big topic
 

1285
00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:22,239
infinitely far ok so another big topic
that comes up a lot is fault tolerance

1286
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:22,249

 

1287
00:29:22,249 --> 00:29:24,680

if you're building a system with a

00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:17,820
service it would have provided even if
 

1431
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,490
service it would have provided even if
there had been no failure so some

1432
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:19,500
there had been no failure so some
 

1433
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,279
there had been no failure so some
systems are available in that sense that

1434
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:21,289
systems are available in that sense that
 

1435
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:24,139
systems are available in that sense that
up and up you know so if you build a

1436
00:32:24,139 --> 00:32:24,149
up and up you know so if you build a
 

1437
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:25,940
up and up you know so if you build a
replicated service that maybe has two

1438
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:25,950
replicated service that maybe has two
 

1439
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,899
replicated service that maybe has two
copies you know one of the replicas

1440
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:28,909
copies you know one of the replicas
 

1441
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:31,760
copies you know one of the replicas
replica servers fail fails maybe the

1442
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:31,770
replica servers fail fails maybe the
 

1443
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,520
replica servers fail fails maybe the
other server can continue operating

1444
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:34,530
other server can continue operating
 

1445
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:37,040
other server can continue operating
they both fail of course you can't you

1446
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,050
they both fail of course you can't you
 

1447
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:40,520
they both fail of course you can't you
know you can't promise availability in

1448
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:40,530
know you can't promise availability in
 

1449
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,140
know you can't promise availability in
that case so available systems usually

1450
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:42,150
that case so available systems usually
 

1451
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,660
that case so available systems usually
say well under certain set of failures

1452
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:44,670
say well under certain set of failures
 

1453
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,130
say well under certain set of failures
we're going to continue providing

1454
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:46,140
we're going to continue providing
 

1455
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,440
we're going to continue providing
service we're going to be available more

1456
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:48,450
service we're going to be available more
 

1457
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,780
service we're going to be available more
failures than that occur it won't be

1458
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:50,790
failures than that occur it won't be
 

1459
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,720
failures than that occur it won't be
available anymore

1460
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:52,730
available anymore
 

1461
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,070
available anymore
another kind of fault tolerance you

1462
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,080
another kind of fault tolerance you
 

1463
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,920
another kind of fault tolerance you
might you might have or in addition to

1464
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:57,930
might you might have or in addition to
 

1465
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,120
might you might have or in addition to
availability or by itself as

00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,130
availability or by itself as
 

1467
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:06,470
availability or by itself as
recoverability and what this means is

1468
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:06,480
recoverability and what this means is
 

1469
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,150
recoverability and what this means is
that if something goes wrong maybe the

1470
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:08,160
that if something goes wrong maybe the
 

1471
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,190
that if something goes wrong maybe the
service will stop working that it is

1472
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:10,200
service will stop working that it is
 

1473
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,030
service will stop working that it is
it'll simply stop responding to requests

1474
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,040
it'll simply stop responding to requests
 

1475
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,770
it'll simply stop responding to requests
and it will wait for someone to come

1476
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:15,780
and it will wait for someone to come
 

1477
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,420
and it will wait for someone to come
along and repair or whatever went wrong

1478
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:17,430
along and repair or whatever went wrong
 

1479
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,640
along and repair or whatever went wrong
but after the repair occurs the system

1480
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:19,650
but after the repair occurs the system
 

1481
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,890
but after the repair occurs the system
will be able to continue as if nothing

1482
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:21,900
will be able to continue as if nothing
 

1483
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,410
will be able to continue as if nothing
bad had gone wrong right so this is sort

1484
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:24,420
bad had gone wrong right so this is sort
 

1485
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,580
bad had gone wrong right so this is sort
of a weaker requirement than

of a weaker requirement than
 

1487
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,800
of a weaker requirement than
availability because here we're not

00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:29,640
going to do anything while while the
 

1491
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,130
going to do anything while while the
failed come until the failed component

1492
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:31,140
failed come until the failed component
 

1493
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,710
failed come until the failed component
has been repaired but the fact that we

1494
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:33,720
has been repaired but the fact that we
 

1495
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,220
has been repaired but the fact that we
can get up get going again without you

1496
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:37,230
can get up get going again without you
 

1497
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,500
can get up get going again without you
know but without any loss of correctness

know but without any loss of correctness
 

1499
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,870

is still a significant requirement it

1500
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:41,880
is still a significant requirement it
 

1501
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,490
is still a significant requirement it
means you know recoverable systems

1502
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:43,500
means you know recoverable systems
 

1503
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,680
means you know recoverable systems
typically need to do things like save

00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,340
systems are SPECT is that they're
available until some number of failures

00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:07,350
available until some number of failures
 

1521
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,139
available until some number of failures
have happened if too many failures have

1522
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:09,149
have happened if too many failures have
 

1523
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:11,659
have happened if too many failures have
happened an available system will stop

1524
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:11,669
happened an available system will stop
 

1525
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:14,810
happened an available system will stop
working or you know will stop responding

1526
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:14,820
working or you know will stop responding
 

1527
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,860
working or you know will stop responding
at all but when enough things have been

1528
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:18,870

1529
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,320
at all but when enough things have been
repaired it'll continue operating so a

1530
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,330
repaired it'll continue operating so a
 

1531
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,419
repaired it'll continue operating so a
good available system will sort of be

1532
00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:23,429
good available system will sort of be
 

1533
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,129
good available system will sort of be

a number of approaches to solving these
 

1547
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,770
a number of approaches to solving these
problems there's really sort of

00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,169
problems there's really sort of
things that are the most important tools

00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:50,179
things that are the most important tools
 

1551
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:52,630
things that are the most important tools
we have in this department one is

1552
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:52,640
we have in this department one is
 

1553
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,840
we have in this department one is
non-volatile storage so that you know

1554
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:55,850
non-volatile storage so that you know
 

1555
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:58,410
non-volatile storage so that you know
something crash power fails or whatever

1556
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:58,420
something crash power fails or whatever
 

1557
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,300
something crash power fails or whatever
there's a building wide power failure we

1558
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:01,310
there's a building wide power failure we
 

1559
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,740
there's a building wide power failure we
can use non-volatile store it's like

1560
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:02,750
can use non-volatile store it's like
 

1561
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,320
can use non-volatile store it's like
hard drives or flash or solid-state

1562
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,330
hard drives or flash or solid-state
 

1563
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,420
hard drives or flash or solid-state
drives or something to sort of store a

1564
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:07,430
drives or something to sort of store a
 

1565
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:12,670
drives or something to sort of store a
check point or a log of the state of a

1566
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:12,680
check point or a log of the state of a
 

1567
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,470
check point or a log of the state of a
system and then when the power comes

1568
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:14,480
system and then when the power comes
 

1569
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,750
system and then when the power comes
back up or somebody repairs our power

1570
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:16,760
back up or somebody repairs our power
 

1571
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,010

suppliers notice what we'll be able to

1572
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:18,020
suppliers notice what we'll be able to
 

1573
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,500
suppliers notice what we'll be able to
read our latest state off the hard drive

1574
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:20,510
read our latest state off the hard drive
 

1575
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:24,610
read our latest state off the hard drive
and continue from there so so one tool

1576
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:24,620
and continue from there so so one tool
 

1577
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:29,380
and continue from there so so one tool
is sort of non-volatile storage and the

1578
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:29,390
is sort of non-volatile storage and the
 

1579
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,000
is sort of non-volatile storage and the
management of non-volatile storage just

1580
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,010
management of non-volatile storage just
 

1581
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,830
management of non-volatile storage just
Ning comes up a lot because non-volatile

1582
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:32,840
Ning comes up a lot because non-volatile
 

1583
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,990
Ning comes up a lot because non-volatile
storage tends to be expensive to update

1584
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:35,000
storage tends to be expensive to update
 

1585
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,450
storage tends to be expensive to update
and so a huge amount of the sort of

1586
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:37,460

building a distributed storage system
 

1657
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,410
building a distributed storage system
and it's a key/value service so it just

1658
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:24,420
and it's a key/value service so it just
 

1659
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,599
and it's a key/value service so it just
supports two operations maybe there's a

00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:26,609
supports two operations maybe there's a
 

1661
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:29,809
supports two operations maybe there's a
put operation and you give it a key and

1662
00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:29,819
put operation and you give it a key and
 

1663
00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:33,079
put operation and you give it a key and
a value and that the storage system sort

1664
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:33,089
a value and that the storage system sort
 

1665
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:36,200
a value and that the storage system sort
of stashes away the value under as the

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,240
there's a good operation you the client
sends it a key and the storage service

to ative Lee you know what put means is

1744
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:08,980
to ative Lee you know what put means is

to ative Lee you know what put means is
update the table and what get means is

1746
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:10,870
update the table and what get means is
 

1747
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,540
update the table and what get means is
just get me the version that's stored in

1748
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:12,550
just get me the version that's stored in
 

1749
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:17,040
just get me the version that's stored in
the table which but in a distributed

some client issues a put and you know

1764
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:36,910
some client issues a put and you know
 

1765
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:43,020
some client issues a put and you know
there's two copies of the the server so

1766
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,030
there's two copies of the the server so
 

1767
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:48,060
there's two copies of the the server so
they both have a key value table right

1768
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:48,070
they both have a key value table right
 

1769
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:51,540
they both have a key value table right
and maybe key one has value twenty on

1770
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:51,550
and maybe key one has value twenty on
 

1771
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:55,350
and maybe key one has value twenty on
both of them and then some client issues

1772
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:55,360
both of them and then some client issues
 

1773
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,980
both of them and then some client issues
a put nice we have client over here and

1774
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:58,990
a put nice we have client over here and
 

1775
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,300
a put nice we have client over here and
it's gonna send a put it wants to update

1776
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:00,310
it's gonna send a put it wants to update
 

1777
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:03,480
it's gonna send a put it wants to update
the value of one to be twenty-one all

1778
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:03,490
the value of one to be twenty-one all
 

1779
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,950
the value of one to be twenty-one all
right maybe it's counting stuff in this

1780
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:04,960
right maybe it's counting stuff in this
 

1781
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,540
right maybe it's counting stuff in this
key value server so sends a put with key

1782
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:09,550
key value server so sends a put with key
 

1783
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:13,740
key value server so sends a put with key
one and value twenty one it sends it to

1784
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:13,750
one and value twenty one it sends it to
 

1785
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,830
one and value twenty one it sends it to
the first server and it's about to send

1786
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:15,840
the first server and it's about to send
 

1787
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,000
the first server and it's about to send
the same put you know wants to update

1788
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,010
the same put you know wants to update
 

1789
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,370
the same put you know wants to update
both copies right it keeps them in sync

1790
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:20,380
both copies right it keeps them in sync
 

1791
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,290
both copies right it keeps them in sync
it's about to send this put but just

00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:22,300
it's about to send this put but just
 

1793
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,520
it's about to send this put but just
before it sends to put to the second

1794
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:23,530
before it sends to put to the second
 

1795

operating system or something so now the

1798
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:28,690
operating system or something so now the
 

1799
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,630
operating system or something so now the
state were left in sadly is that we sent

1800
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:30,640
state were left in sadly is that we sent
 

1801
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,460
state were left in sadly is that we sent
this put and so we've updated one of the

1802
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:35,470
this put and so we've updated one of the
 

1803
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,290
this put and so we've updated one of the
two replicas didn't have value twenty

1804
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:37,300
two replicas didn't have value twenty
 

1805
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,580
two replicas didn't have value twenty
one but the other ones still with twenty

1806
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:38,590
one but the other ones still with twenty
 

1807
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,860
one but the other ones still with twenty
now somebody comes along and reads with

1808
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:40,870
now somebody comes along and reads with
 

1809
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,900
now somebody comes along and reads with
a get and they might get they want to

1810
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:42,910
a get and they might get they want to
 

1811
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:45,060
a get and they might get they want to
read the value associated with key one

1812
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,070
read the value associated with key one
 

1813
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,410
read the value associated with key one
they might get twenty one or they might

1814
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:46,420
they might get twenty one or they might
 

1815
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,090
they might get twenty one or they might
get twenty depending on who they talk to

1816
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:48,100
get twenty depending on who they talk to
 

1817
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,340
get twenty depending on who they talk to
and even if the rule is you always talk

1818
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:50,350
and even if the rule is you always talk
 

1819
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,590
and even if the rule is you always talk
to the top server first if you're

1820
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:52,600
to the top server first if you're
 

1821
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,820
to the top server first if you're
building a fault-tolerant system the

1822
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:53,830
building a fault-tolerant system the
 

1823
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:56,010
building a fault-tolerant system the
actual rule has to be oh you talk to the

1824
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:56,020
actual rule has to be oh you talk to the
 

1825
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,990
actual rule has to be oh you talk to the
top server first unless it's failed in

1826
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:58,000
top server first unless it's failed in
 

1827
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,800
top server first unless it's failed in
which case you talk to the bottom server

1828
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:00,810
which case you talk to the bottom server
 

1829
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:03,630
which case you talk to the bottom server
so either way someday you risk exposing

1830
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:03,640
so either way someday you risk exposing
 

1831
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,600
so either way someday you risk exposing
this stale copy of the data to some

1832
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:06,610
this stale copy of the data to some
 

1833
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,640
this stale copy of the data to some
future again it could be that many gets

1834
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:08,650
future again it could be that many gets
 

1835
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,620
future again it could be that many gets
get the updated twenty one and then like

1836
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:10,630
get the updated twenty one and then like
 

1837
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,720
get the updated twenty one and then like
next week all of a sudden some get

1838
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:12,730
next week all of a sudden some get
 

1839
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,910
next week all of a sudden some get
yields you know a week old copy of the

1840
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:14,920
yields you know a week old copy of the
 

1841
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,360
yields you know a week old copy of the
data so that's not very consistent

1842
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,370
data so that's not very consistent
 

1843
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:23,710
data so that's not very consistent
right so in order but you know it's the

1844
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:23,720
right so in order but you know it's the
 

1845
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,860
right so in order but you know it's the
kind of thing that could happen right

1846
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:25,870
kind of thing that could happen right
 

1847
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:29,200
kind of thing that could happen right
we're not careful so you know we need to

1848
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:29,210
we're not careful so you know we need to
 

1849
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:32,410
we're not careful so you know we need to
have we need to actually write down what

1850
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:32,420
have we need to actually write down what
 

1851
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,910
have we need to actually write down what
the rules are going to be about puts and

1852
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:33,920
the rules are going to be about puts and
 

1853
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,640
the rules are going to be about puts and
gets given this danger of due to

1854
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:36,650
gets given this danger of due to
 

1855
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:39,220
gets given this danger of due to
replication and it turns out there's

1856
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:39,230
replication and it turns out there's
 

1857
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,640
replication and it turns out there's
many different definitions you can have

1858
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:42,650
many different definitions you can have
 

1859
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:47,020
many different definitions you can have
of consistency you know many of them are

1860
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,030
of consistency you know many of them are
 

1861
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,460
of consistency you know many of them are
relatively straightforward many of them

1862
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:48,470
relatively straightforward many of them
 

1863
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:52,930
relatively straightforward many of them
sound like well I get yields the you

1864
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:52,940
sound like well I get yields the you
 

1865
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,240
sound like well I get yields the you
know value put by the most recently

1866
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:55,250
know value put by the most recently
 

1867
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:00,160
know value put by the most recently
completed put all right so that's

1868
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,170
completed put all right so that's
 

1869
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:02,950
completed put all right so that's
usually called strong consistency it

1870
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:02,960
usually called strong consistency it
 

1871
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,380
usually called strong consistency it
turns out also it's very useful to build

1872
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:05,390
turns out also it's very useful to build
 

1873
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,730
turns out also it's very useful to build
systems that have much weaker

00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:06,740
systems that have much weaker
 

1875
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,650
systems that have much weaker
consistency there for example do not

1876
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:08,660
consistency there for example do not
 

1877
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,980
consistency there for example do not
guarantee anything like a get sees the

1878
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:11,990
guarantee anything like a get sees the
 

1879
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,160
guarantee anything like a get sees the
value written by the most recent put and

1880
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:15,170
value written by the most recent put and
 

1881
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:18,430
value written by the most recent put and
the reason so there's there strongly

1882
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:18,440
the reason so there's there strongly
 

1883
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,020
the reason so there's there strongly
consistent systems they usually have

consistent systems they usually have
 

1885
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,120

00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:21,490
this really runs you into trouble is
that if we're using replication for

that if we're using replication for
 

1979

that if we're using replication for

so for example putting both of the

00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:09,279
wasteful of engineering effort but they
wanted to hire people who were skilled

2210
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:09,289
wanted to hire people who were skilled
 

2211
00:49:09,289 --> 00:49:15,150
wanted to hire people who were skilled
at something else and not necessarily

2212
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:15,160

 

2213
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,900

engineers who wanted to spend all their

2214
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:16,910
engineers who wanted to spend all their
 

2215
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,549
engineers who wanted to spend all their
time writing distributed system software

2216
00:49:18,549 --> 00:49:18,559
time writing distributed system software
 

2217
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,349
time writing distributed system software
so they really needed some kind of

2218
00:49:20,349 --> 00:49:20,359
so they really needed some kind of
 

2219
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:22,299
so they really needed some kind of
framework that would make it easy to

2220
00:49:22,299 --> 00:49:22,309
framework that would make it easy to
 

2221
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:26,079
framework that would make it easy to
just have their engineers write the kind

2222
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:26,089
just have their engineers write the kind
 

2223
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:28,120
just have their engineers write the kind
of guts of whatever analysis they wanted

2224
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,130
of guts of whatever analysis they wanted
 

2225
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,130
of guts of whatever analysis they wanted
to do like the sort algorithm or a web

2226
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:30,140
to do like the sort algorithm or a web
 

2227
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,980
to do like the sort algorithm or a web
index or link analyzer or whatever just

2228
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:32,990
index or link analyzer or whatever just
 

2229
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:34,539
index or link analyzer or whatever just
write the guts of that application and

2230
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:34,549
write the guts of that application and
 

2231
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:36,730
write the guts of that application and
not be able to run it on a thousands of

not be able to run it on a thousands of
computers without worrying about the

2234
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:39,710
computers without worrying about the
 

2235
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,529
computers without worrying about the
details of how to spread the work over

2236
00:49:41,529 --> 00:49:41,539
details of how to spread the work over
 

2237
00:49:41,539 --> 00:49:43,720
details of how to spread the work over
the thousands of computers how to

00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:43,730
the thousands of computers how to
 

2239
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,940
the thousands of computers how to
organize whatever data movement was

00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:45,950
organize whatever data movement was

organize whatever data movement was
required how to cope with the inevitable

2242
00:49:48,339 --> 00:49:48,349
required how to cope with the inevitable
 

2243
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:50,620
required how to cope with the inevitable
failures so they were looking for a

2244
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:50,630
failures so they were looking for a
 

2245
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,999
failures so they were looking for a
framework that would make it easy for

2246
00:49:51,999 --> 00:49:52,009
framework that would make it easy for
 

2247
00:49:52,009 --> 00:49:54,730
framework that would make it easy for
non specialists to be able to write and

2248
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:54,740
non specialists to be able to write and
 

2249
00:49:54,740 --> 00:50:00,309
non specialists to be able to write and
run giant distributed computations and

2250
00:50:00,309 --> 00:50:00,319
run giant distributed computations and
 

2251
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,599
run giant distributed computations and
so that's what MapReduce is all about

2252
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:03,609
so that's what MapReduce is all about
 

2253
00:50:03,609 --> 00:50:06,460
so that's what MapReduce is all about
and the idea is that the programmer just

2254
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:06,470
and the idea is that the programmer just
 

2255
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:09,920
and the idea is that the programmer just
write the application designer

2256
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:09,930
write the application designer
 

2257
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:11,990
write the application designer
consumer of this distributed computation

00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,359
consumer of this distributed computation
I'm just be able to write a simple map

2260
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:14,369
I'm just be able to write a simple map
 

2261
00:50:14,369 --> 00:50:16,069
I'm just be able to write a simple map
function and a simple reduce function

2262
00:50:16,069 --> 00:50:16,079
function and a simple reduce function
 

2263
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,230
function and a simple reduce function
that don't know anything about

2264
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:18,240
that don't know anything about
 

2265
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,630
that don't know anything about
distribution and the MapReduce framework

2266
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:20,640
distribution and the MapReduce framework
 

2267
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,069
distribution and the MapReduce framework
would take care of everything else so an

2268
00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:25,079
would take care of everything else so an
 

2269
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:27,859
would take care of everything else so an
abstract view of how what MapReduce is

2270
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:27,869
abstract view of how what MapReduce is
 

2271
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:30,890
abstract view of how what MapReduce is
up to is it starts by assuming that

2272
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:30,900
up to is it starts by assuming that
 

2273
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,020
up to is it starts by assuming that
there's some input and the input is

2274
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:33,030
there's some input and the input is
 

2275
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,420
there's some input and the input is
split up into some a whole bunch of

2276
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:35,430
split up into some a whole bunch of
 

2277
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:37,549
split up into some a whole bunch of
different files or chunks in some way so

2278
00:50:37,549 --> 00:50:37,559
different files or chunks in some way so
 

2279
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:43,099
different files or chunks in some way so
we're imagining that no yeah you know

2280
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:43,109
we're imagining that no yeah you know
 

2281
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:51,109
we're imagining that no yeah you know
input file one and put file two etc you

2282
00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:51,119
input file one and put file two etc you
 

2283
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,230
input file one and put file two etc you
know these inputs are maybe you know web

2284
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:54,240
know these inputs are maybe you know web
 

2285
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,910
know these inputs are maybe you know web
pages crawled from the web or more

00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:55,920
pages crawled from the web or more
 

2287
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,010
pages crawled from the web or more
likely sort of big files that contain

00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:58,020
likely sort of big files that contain
 

2289
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,170
likely sort of big files that contain
many web each of which contains many web

2290
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:00,180
many web each of which contains many web
 

2291
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,410
many web each of which contains many web
files crawl from the web all right and

2292
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:03,420
files crawl from the web all right and
 

2293
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,809
files crawl from the web all right and
the way Map Reduce

2294
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:04,819
the way Map Reduce
 

2295
00:51:04,819 --> 00:51:07,940
the way Map Reduce
starts is that you're to find a map

2296
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:07,950
starts is that you're to find a map
 

2297
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:09,650
starts is that you're to find a map
function and the MapReduce framework is

2298
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:09,660
function and the MapReduce framework is
 

2299
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:15,880
function and the MapReduce framework is
gonna run your map function on each of

2300
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:15,890
gonna run your map function on each of
 

2301
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:22,190
gonna run your map function on each of
the input files and of course you can

2302
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:22,200
the input files and of course you can
 

2303
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,180
the input files and of course you can
see here there's some obvious

2304
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:23,190
see here there's some obvious
 

2305
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:26,960
see here there's some obvious
parallelism available can run the maps

2306
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:26,970
parallelism available can run the maps
 

2307
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:28,339
parallelism available can run the maps
in parallel so the each of these map

2308
00:51:28,339 --> 00:51:28,349
in parallel so the each of these map
 

2309
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:30,049
in parallel so the each of these map
functions only looks as this input and

2310
00:51:30,049 --> 00:51:30,059
functions only looks as this input and
 

2311
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:32,390
functions only looks as this input and
produces output the output that a map

2312
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:32,400
produces output the output that a map
 

2313
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,980
produces output the output that a map
function is required to produce is a

2314
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:33,990
function is required to produce is a
 

2315
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:36,740
function is required to produce is a
list you know it takes a file as input

2316
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:36,750
list you know it takes a file as input
 

2317
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:39,740
list you know it takes a file as input
and the file is some fraction of the

2318
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:39,750
and the file is some fraction of the
 

2319
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,170
and the file is some fraction of the
input data and it produces a list of key

2320
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:42,180
input data and it produces a list of key
 

2321
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:45,609
input data and it produces a list of key
value pairs as output the map function

2322
00:51:45,609 --> 00:51:45,619
value pairs as output the map function
 

2323
00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:48,500
value pairs as output the map function
and so for example let's suppose we're

2324
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:48,510
and so for example let's suppose we're
 

2325
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:50,569
and so for example let's suppose we're
writing the simplest possible MapReduce

2326
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:50,579
writing the simplest possible MapReduce
 

2327
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:56,390
writing the simplest possible MapReduce
example a word count MapReduce job goal

2328
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:56,400
example a word count MapReduce job goal
 

2329
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,160
example a word count MapReduce job goal
is to count the number of occurrences of

2330
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:58,170
is to count the number of occurrences of
 

2331
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:00,380
is to count the number of occurrences of
each word so your map function might

2332
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:00,390
each word so your map function might
 

2333
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:02,809
each word so your map function might
emit key value pairs where the key is

2334
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:02,819
emit key value pairs where the key is
 

2335
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:06,920
emit key value pairs where the key is
the word and the value is just one so

2336
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:06,930
the word and the value is just one so
 

2337
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:08,900
the word and the value is just one so
for every word at C so then this map

2338
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:08,910
for every word at C so then this map
 

2339
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:10,400
for every word at C so then this map
function will split the input up into

2340
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:10,410
function will split the input up into
 

2341
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:11,750
function will split the input up into
words or everywhere ditzies

2342
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:11,760
words or everywhere ditzies
 

2343
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,299
words or everywhere ditzies
it emits that word as the key and 1 as

2344
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:14,309
it emits that word as the key and 1 as
 

2345
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:16,160
it emits that word as the key and 1 as
the value and then later on will count

2346
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:16,170
the value and then later on will count
 

2347
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:18,349
the value and then later on will count
up all those ones in order to get the

2348
00:52:18,349 --> 00:52:18,359
up all those ones in order to get the
 

2349
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:21,410
up all those ones in order to get the
final output so you know maybe input 1

2350
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:21,420
final output so you know maybe input 1
 

2351
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,219
final output so you know maybe input 1
has the word

2352
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:23,229
has the word
 

2353
00:52:23,229 --> 00:52:26,459
has the word
a in it and the word B in it and so the

2354
00:52:26,459 --> 00:52:26,469
a in it and the word B in it and so the
 

2355
00:52:26,469 --> 00:52:28,559
a in it and the word B in it and so the
output the map is going to produce is

2356
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:28,569
output the map is going to produce is
 

2357
00:52:28,569 --> 00:52:32,670
output the map is going to produce is
key a value one key B value one maybe

2358
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:32,680
key a value one key B value one maybe
 

2359
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,640
key a value one key B value one maybe
the second not communication sees a file

2360
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:35,650
the second not communication sees a file
 

2361
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:38,880
the second not communication sees a file
that has a B in it and nothing else so

2362
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:38,890
that has a B in it and nothing else so
 

2363
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:43,109
that has a B in it and nothing else so
it's going to implement output b1 maybe

2364
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:43,119
it's going to implement output b1 maybe
 

2365
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,079
it's going to implement output b1 maybe
this third input has an A in it and a C

2366
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:46,089
this third input has an A in it and a C
 

2367
00:52:46,089 --> 00:52:50,130
this third input has an A in it and a C
in it alright so we run all these maps

2368
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:50,140
in it alright so we run all these maps
 

2369
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:53,370
in it alright so we run all these maps
on all the input files and we get this

2370
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:53,380
on all the input files and we get this
 

2371
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,049
on all the input files and we get this
intermediate with the paper calls

2372
00:52:55,049 --> 00:52:55,059
intermediate with the paper calls
 

2373
00:52:55,059 --> 00:52:57,120
intermediate with the paper calls
intermediate output which is for every

2374
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:57,130
intermediate output which is for every
 

2375
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:00,410
intermediate output which is for every
map a set of key value pairs as output

2376
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:00,420
map a set of key value pairs as output
 

2377
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:03,120
map a set of key value pairs as output
then the second stage of the computation

2378
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:03,130
then the second stage of the computation
 

2379
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:07,049
then the second stage of the computation
is to run the reduces and the idea is

2380
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:07,059
is to run the reduces and the idea is
 

2381
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:09,449
is to run the reduces and the idea is
that the MapReduce framework collects

2382
00:53:09,449 --> 00:53:09,459
that the MapReduce framework collects
 

2383
00:53:09,459 --> 00:53:12,599
that the MapReduce framework collects
together all instances from all maps of

2384
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:12,609
together all instances from all maps of
 

2385
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:15,120
together all instances from all maps of
each key word so the MapReduce framework

2386
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:15,130
each key word so the MapReduce framework
 

2387
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:16,859
each key word so the MapReduce framework
is going to collect together all of the

2388
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:16,869
is going to collect together all of the
 

2389
00:53:16,869 --> 00:53:20,729
is going to collect together all of the
A's you know from every map every key

2390
00:53:20,729 --> 00:53:20,739
A's you know from every map every key
 

2391
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,589
A's you know from every map every key
value pair whose key was a it's gonna

2392
00:53:22,589 --> 00:53:22,599
value pair whose key was a it's gonna
 

2393
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:30,380
value pair whose key was a it's gonna
take collect them all and hand them to

2394
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:30,390

 

2395
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:33,059

one call of the programmer to find

2396
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:33,069
one call of the programmer to find
 

2397
00:53:33,069 --> 00:53:35,519
one call of the programmer to find
reduce function and then it's gonna take

2398
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:35,529
reduce function and then it's gonna take
 

2399
00:53:35,529 --> 00:53:38,309
reduce function and then it's gonna take
all the B's and collect them together of

2400
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:38,319
all the B's and collect them together of
 

2401
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:39,689
all the B's and collect them together of
course you know requires a real

00:53:39,689 --> 00:53:39,699
course you know requires a real
 

2403
00:53:39,699 --> 00:53:42,329
course you know requires a real
collection because they were different

2404
00:53:42,329 --> 00:53:42,339
collection because they were different
 

2405
00:53:42,339 --> 00:53:44,009
collection because they were different
instances of key B were produced by

2406
00:53:44,009 --> 00:53:44,019
instances of key B were produced by
 

2407
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:46,979
instances of key B were produced by
different indications of map on

2408
00:53:46,979 --> 00:53:46,989
different indications of map on
 

2409
00:53:46,989 --> 00:53:48,599
different indications of map on
different computers so we're not talking

00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:48,609
different computers so we're not talking
 

2411
00:53:48,609 --> 00:53:50,670
different computers so we're not talking
about data movement I'm so we're gonna

2412
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:50,680
about data movement I'm so we're gonna
 

2413
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,329
about data movement I'm so we're gonna
collect all the B keys and hand them to

2414
00:53:53,329 --> 00:53:53,339
collect all the B keys and hand them to
 

2415
00:53:53,339 --> 00:53:58,709
collect all the B keys and hand them to
a different call to reduce that has all

2416
00:53:58,709 --> 00:53:58,719
a different call to reduce that has all
 

2417
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:01,949
a different call to reduce that has all
of the B keys as its arguments and same

2419
00:54:01,959 --> 00:54:07,620
of the B keys as its arguments and same

2423
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,759
MapReduce framework will arrange for one
call to reduce for every key that

2424
00:54:11,759 --> 00:54:11,769
call to reduce for every key that
 

2425
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:17,130
call to reduce for every key that
occurred in any of the math output and

00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:17,140
occurred in any of the math output and
 

2427
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,439
occurred in any of the math output and
you know for our sort of silly word

2428
00:54:19,439 --> 00:54:19,449
you know for our sort of silly word
 

2429
00:54:19,449 --> 00:54:23,489
you know for our sort of silly word
count example all these reduces have to

2430
00:54:23,489 --> 00:54:23,499
count example all these reduces have to
 

2431
00:54:23,499 --> 00:54:25,049
count example all these reduces have to
do or any one of them has to do is just

2432
00:54:25,049 --> 00:54:25,059
do or any one of them has to do is just
 

2433
00:54:25,059 --> 00:54:28,319
do or any one of them has to do is just
count the number of items passed to it

2434
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:28,329
count the number of items passed to it
 

2435
00:54:28,329 --> 00:54:29,640
count the number of items passed to it
doesn't even have to look at the items

2436
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:29,650
doesn't even have to look at the items
 

2437
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,049
doesn't even have to look at the items
because it knows that each of them is

2438
00:54:31,049 --> 00:54:31,059
because it knows that each of them is
 

2439
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:34,469
because it knows that each of them is
the word is responsible for plus one is

2440
00:54:34,469 --> 00:54:34,479
the word is responsible for plus one is
 

2441
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,759
the word is responsible for plus one is
the value you don't have to look at

2442
00:54:35,759 --> 00:54:35,769
the value you don't have to look at
 

2443
00:54:35,769 --> 00:54:36,870
the value you don't have to look at
those ones we've just count

2444
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:36,880
those ones we've just count
 

2445
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,580
those ones we've just count
so this reduce is going to produce a and

2446
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:41,590
so this reduce is going to produce a and
 

2447
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:44,570
so this reduce is going to produce a and
then the count of its inputs this reduce

2448
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:44,580
then the count of its inputs this reduce
 

2449
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:47,670
then the count of its inputs this reduce
it's going to produce the key associated

2450
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:47,680
it's going to produce the key associated
 

2451
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,340
it's going to produce the key associated
with it and then count of its values

2452
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:50,350
with it and then count of its values
 

2453
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:57,030
with it and then count of its values
which is also two so this is what a

2454
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:57,040
which is also two so this is what a
 

2455
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,980
which is also two so this is what a
typical MapReduce job looks like the

2456
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:01,990
typical MapReduce job looks like the
 

2457
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:07,190
typical MapReduce job looks like the
high level just for completeness the

2458
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:07,200
high level just for completeness the
 

2459
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,090
high level just for completeness the
well some a little bit of terminology

2460
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:09,100
well some a little bit of terminology
 

2461
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:12,470
well some a little bit of terminology
the whole computation is called the job

2462
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:12,480
the whole computation is called the job
 

2463
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,890
the whole computation is called the job
anyone invocation of MapReduce is called

2464
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:16,900
anyone invocation of MapReduce is called
 

2465
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,990
anyone invocation of MapReduce is called
a task so we have the entire job and

2466
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:19,000
a task so we have the entire job and
 

2467
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
a task so we have the entire job and
it's made up of a bunch of math tasks

2468
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,010
it's made up of a bunch of math tasks
 

2469
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:27,210
it's made up of a bunch of math tasks
and then a bunch of produced tasks so

2470
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:27,220
and then a bunch of produced tasks so
 

2471
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,850
and then a bunch of produced tasks so
it's an example for this word count you

2472
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:29,860
it's an example for this word count you
 

2473
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,140
it's an example for this word count you
know the what the map and reduce

2474
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:31,150
know the what the map and reduce
 

2475
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:40,740
know the what the map and reduce
functions would look like the map

2476
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:40,750
functions would look like the map
 

2477
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:45,120
functions would look like the map
function takes a key in the value as

2478
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:45,130
function takes a key in the value as
 

2479
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:46,410
function takes a key in the value as
arguments and now we're talking about

2480
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:46,420
arguments and now we're talking about
 

2481
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,060
arguments and now we're talking about
functions like written in an ordinary

people ordinary people can write what a
 

2489
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,860

map function for word count would do is

2490
00:55:58,860 --> 00:55:58,870
map function for word count would do is
 

2491
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:02,910
map function for word count would do is
split the the key is the file name which

2492
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:02,920
split the the key is the file name which
 

2493
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,100
split the the key is the file name which
typically is ignored we really care what

2494
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:05,110
typically is ignored we really care what
 

2495
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:07,590
typically is ignored we really care what
the file name was and the V is the

2496
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:07,600
the file name was and the V is the
 

2497
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:12,240
the file name was and the V is the
content of this maps input file so V is

2498
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:12,250
content of this maps input file so V is
 

2499
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,390
content of this maps input file so V is
you know just contains all this text

2500
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:14,400
you know just contains all this text
 

2501
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:21,750
you know just contains all this text
we're gonna split V into words and then

2502
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:21,760
we're gonna split V into words and then
 

2503
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:30,880
we're gonna split V into words and then
for each word

2504
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:30,890

 

2505
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:34,120

we're just gonna emit and emit takes two

2506
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:34,130
we're just gonna emit and emit takes two
 

2507
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:36,880
we're just gonna emit and emit takes two
arguments mitts you know calmly map can

00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:36,890
arguments mitts you know calmly map can
 

2509
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:38,410

framework we get to produce we hand emit

2512
00:56:41,289 --> 00:56:41,299
framework we get to produce we hand emit
 

2513
00:56:41,299 --> 00:56:44,880

a key which is the word and a value

2514
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:44,890
a key which is the word and a value
 

2515
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:49,720
a key which is the word and a value
which is the string one so that's it for

which is the string one so that's it for
 

2517
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:53,079
which is the string one so that's it for
the map function and a word count map

the map function and a word count map
 

2519
00:56:53,089 --> 00:56:54,849
the map function and a word count map
function and MapReduce literally it

2520
00:56:54,849 --> 00:56:54,859
function and MapReduce literally it
 

2521
00:56:54,859 --> 00:56:56,549
function and MapReduce literally it
could be this simple

2522
00:56:56,549 --> 00:56:56,559
could be this simple
 

2523
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,299
could be this simple
so there's sort of promise to make the

2524
00:57:00,299 --> 00:57:00,309
so there's sort of promise to make the
 

2525
00:57:00,309 --> 00:57:02,589
so there's sort of promise to make the
and you know this map function doesn't

2526
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:02,599
and you know this map function doesn't
 

2527
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:04,180
and you know this map function doesn't
know anything about distribution or

2528
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:04,190
know anything about distribution or
 

2529
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:06,160
know anything about distribution or
multiple computers or the fact we need

we need to move data across the network

2532
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:07,970
we need to move data across the network
 

2533
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,010
we need to move data across the network
or who knows what

or who knows what
 

2535
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:13,390

this is extremely straightforward and

2536
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:13,400
this is extremely straightforward and
 

2537
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:19,539
this is extremely straightforward and
the reduce function for a word count the

2538
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:19,549
the reduce function for a word count the
 

2539
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:21,880
the reduce function for a word count the
reduce is called with you know remember

MapReduce framework calls reduce with

2546
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:27,170
MapReduce framework calls reduce with
 

2547
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:30,069
MapReduce framework calls reduce with
the key that it's responsible for and a

2548
00:57:30,069 --> 00:57:30,079
the key that it's responsible for and a
 

2549
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:33,400
the key that it's responsible for and a
vector of all the values that the maps

2550
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:33,410
vector of all the values that the maps
 

2551
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:38,380
vector of all the values that the maps
produced associated with that key the

2552
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:38,390
produced associated with that key the
 

2553
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:40,630
produced associated with that key the
key is the word the values are all ones

2554
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:40,640
key is the word the values are all ones
 

2555
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,950
key is the word the values are all ones
we don't like here about them we only

2556
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:41,960
we don't like here about them we only
 

2557
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,500
we don't like here about them we only
care about how many they were and so

2558
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:44,510
care about how many they were and so
 

2559
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:47,410
care about how many they were and so
reduce has its own omit function that

2560
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:47,420
reduce has its own omit function that
 

2561
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:51,190
reduce has its own omit function that
just takes a value to be emitted as the

2562
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:51,200
just takes a value to be emitted as the
 

2563
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,769
just takes a value to be emitted as the
final output as the value for the this

2564
00:57:53,769 --> 00:57:53,779
final output as the value for the this
 

2565
00:57:53,779 --> 00:57:57,819
final output as the value for the this
key so we're gonna admit a length of

2566
00:57:57,819 --> 00:57:57,829
key so we're gonna admit a length of
 

2567
00:57:57,829 --> 00:58:01,779
key so we're gonna admit a length of
this array so this is also about as

00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:01,789
this array so this is also about as

01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:53,170
of processing and with MapReduce you
 

2681
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:54,360
of processing and with MapReduce you
have to sort of cobble that together

from the programmers point of view it's

2704
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:41,650
from the programmers point of view it's
 

2705
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:44,070
from the programmers point of view it's
just about map and reduce from our point

2706
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:44,080
just about map and reduce from our point
 

2707
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,600
just about map and reduce from our point
of view it's going to be about the

of view it's going to be about the
 

2709
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:49,310

call the map and reduce functions so
 

2717
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,920
call the map and reduce functions so
yeah from our point of view we care a

01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:01,930
yeah from our point of view we care a
 

2719
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:04,230
yeah from our point of view we care a
lot about how this is organized by the

01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:04,240
lot about how this is organized by the
 

2721
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,180
lot about how this is organized by the

where does the immediate data go okay so

2730
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:32,170
where does the immediate data go okay so
 

2731
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:35,430
where does the immediate data go okay so
there's two questions one is when you

2732
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:35,440
there's two questions one is when you
 

2733
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,010
there's two questions one is when you
call a MIT what happens to the data and

2734
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:38,020
call a MIT what happens to the data and
 

2735
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:46,900
call a MIT what happens to the data and
the other is where the functions run so

2736
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:46,910

 

2737
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:50,230

the actual answer is that first where

2738
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:50,240
the actual answer is that first where
 

2739
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,019
the actual answer is that first where
the stuff rotten there's a number of say

01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:53,029
the stuff rotten there's a number of say
 

2741
01:02:53,029 --> 01:02:56,529
the stuff rotten there's a number of say
a thousand servers um actually the right

2742
01:02:56,529 --> 01:02:56,539
a thousand servers um actually the right
 

2743
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:58,180
a thousand servers um actually the right
thing to look at here is figure one in

2744
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:58,190
thing to look at here is figure one in
 

2745
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:02,650
thing to look at here is figure one in
the paper sitting underneath this in the

01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:02,660
the paper sitting underneath this in the
 

2747
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,420
the paper sitting underneath this in the
real world there's some big collection

2748
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:04,430
real world there's some big collection
 

2749
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:09,009
real world there's some big collection
of servers and we'll call them maybe

2750
01:03:09,009 --> 01:03:09,019
of servers and we'll call them maybe
 

2751
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:12,400
of servers and we'll call them maybe
worker servers or workers and there's

01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:12,410
worker servers or workers and there's
 

2753
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:14,650
worker servers or workers and there's
also a single master server that's

2754
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:14,660
also a single master server that's
 

2755
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,509
also a single master server that's
organizing the whole computation and

2756
01:03:16,509 --> 01:03:16,519
organizing the whole computation and
 

2757
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:18,880
organizing the whole computation and
what's going on here is the master

process will write this data to files on
 

2793
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:12,759
process will write this data to files on
the local disk so what happens to map

2794
01:04:12,759 --> 01:04:12,769
the local disk so what happens to map
 

2795
01:04:12,769 --> 01:04:17,410
the local disk so what happens to map
emits and is they produce files on the

some of whatever maps were run on that
 

2811
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:42,359
some of whatever maps were run on that
worker machine then the MapReduce

2812
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:42,369
worker machine then the MapReduce

01:05:04,289 --> 01:05:08,589
out you know this is a simple example
but probably in general every single map

but probably in general every single map
 

2831
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:10,460
but probably in general every single map
indication will have produce lots of

keys including some instances of key a
 

2835
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,380
keys including some instances of key a
so typically in order before we can even

2836
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:15,390
so typically in order before we can even
 

2837
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:17,450
so typically in order before we can even
run this reduce function the MapReduce

2838
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:17,460
run this reduce function the MapReduce
 

2839
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:20,180
run this reduce function the MapReduce
framework that is the MapReduce worker

2840
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:20,190
framework that is the MapReduce worker
 

2841
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:22,579
framework that is the MapReduce worker
running on one of our thousand servers

2842
01:05:22,579 --> 01:05:22,589
running on one of our thousand servers
 

2843
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:24,259
running on one of our thousand servers
is going to have to go talk to every

01:05:24,259 --> 01:05:24,269
is going to have to go talk to every
 

2845
01:05:24,269 --> 01:05:26,569
is going to have to go talk to every
single other of the thousand servers and

01:05:26,569 --> 01:05:26,579
single other of the thousand servers and
 

2847
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:28,519
single other of the thousand servers and
say look you know I'm gonna run the

2848
01:05:28,519 --> 01:05:28,529
say look you know I'm gonna run the
 

2849
01:05:28,529 --> 01:05:31,160
say look you know I'm gonna run the
reduce for key a please look at the

2850
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:31,170
reduce for key a please look at the
 

2851
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:33,200
reduce for key a please look at the
intermediate map output stored in your

2852
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:33,210
intermediate map output stored in your
 

2853
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:35,870
intermediate map output stored in your
disk and fish out all of the instances

2854
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:35,880
disk and fish out all of the instances
 

2855
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,150
disk and fish out all of the instances
of key a and send them over the network

2856
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:38,160
of key a and send them over the network
 

2857
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,059
of key a and send them over the network
to me so the reduce worker is going to

2858
01:05:41,059 --> 01:05:41,069
to me so the reduce worker is going to
 

2859
01:05:41,069 --> 01:05:43,519
to me so the reduce worker is going to
do that it's going to fetch from every

2860
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:43,529
do that it's going to fetch from every
 

2861
01:05:43,529 --> 01:05:45,950
do that it's going to fetch from every
worker all of the instances of the key

2862
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:45,960
worker all of the instances of the key
 

2863
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,390
worker all of the instances of the key
that it's responsible for that the

2864
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:47,400
that it's responsible for that the
 

2865
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,329
that it's responsible for that the
master has told it to be responsible for

2866
01:05:50,329 --> 01:05:50,339
master has told it to be responsible for
 

2867
01:05:50,339 --> 01:05:51,829
master has told it to be responsible for
and once it's collected all of that data

2868
01:05:51,829 --> 01:05:51,839
and once it's collected all of that data
 

2869
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:55,809
and once it's collected all of that data
then it can call reduce and the reduce

2870
01:05:55,809 --> 01:05:55,819
then it can call reduce and the reduce
 

2871
01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:58,460
then it can call reduce and the reduce
function itself calls reduce omit which

2872
01:05:58,460 --> 01:05:58,470
function itself calls reduce omit which
 

2873
01:05:58,470 --> 01:06:01,880
function itself calls reduce omit which
is different from the map in it and what

2874
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:01,890
is different from the map in it and what
 

2875
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:04,700
is different from the map in it and what
reduces emit does is writes the output

2876
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:04,710
reduces emit does is writes the output
 

2877
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:12,140
reduces emit does is writes the output
to a file in a cluster file service that

2878
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:12,150
to a file in a cluster file service that
 

2879
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:14,509
to a file in a cluster file service that
Google uses so here's something I

2880
01:06:14,509 --> 01:06:14,519
Google uses so here's something I
 

2881
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:17,960
Google uses so here's something I
haven't mentioned I haven't mentioned

2882
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:17,970
haven't mentioned I haven't mentioned
 

2883
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:21,319
haven't mentioned I haven't mentioned
where the input lives and where the

2884
01:06:21,319 --> 01:06:21,329
where the input lives and where the
 

2885
01:06:21,329 --> 01:06:25,519
where the input lives and where the
output lives they're both files because

2886
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:25,529
output lives they're both files because
 

2887
01:06:25,529 --> 01:06:28,789
output lives they're both files because
any piece of input we want the

2888
01:06:28,789 --> 01:06:28,799
any piece of input we want the
 

2889
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:31,309
any piece of input we want the
flexibility to be able to read any piece

2890
01:06:31,309 --> 01:06:31,319
flexibility to be able to read any piece
 

2891
01:06:31,319 --> 01:06:34,579
flexibility to be able to read any piece
of input on any worker server that means

2892
01:06:34,579 --> 01:06:34,589
of input on any worker server that means
 

2893
01:06:34,589 --> 01:06:36,789
of input on any worker server that means
we need some kind of network file system

2894
01:06:36,789 --> 01:06:36,799
we need some kind of network file system
 

2895
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:42,499
we need some kind of network file system
to store the input data and so indeed

2896
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:42,509
to store the input data and so indeed
 

2897
01:06:42,509 --> 01:06:44,089
to store the input data and so indeed
the paper talks about this thing called

2898
01:06:44,089 --> 01:06:44,099
the paper talks about this thing called
 

2899
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:50,150
the paper talks about this thing called
GFS or Google file system and GFS is a

2900
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:50,160
GFS or Google file system and GFS is a
 

2901
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,980
GFS or Google file system and GFS is a
cluster file system and BFS actually

2902
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:51,990
cluster file system and BFS actually
 

2903
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:54,200
cluster file system and BFS actually
runs on exactly the same set of workers

2904
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:54,210
runs on exactly the same set of workers
 

2905
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,710
runs on exactly the same set of workers
that work our servers that run MapReduce

2906
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:56,720
that work our servers that run MapReduce
 

2907
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,620
that work our servers that run MapReduce
and the input GFS just automatically

2908
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:00,630
and the input GFS just automatically
 

2909
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:02,210
and the input GFS just automatically
when you you know it's a file system you

2910
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:02,220
when you you know it's a file system you
 

2911
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:03,829
when you you know it's a file system you
can read in my files it just

2912
01:07:03,829 --> 01:07:03,839
can read in my files it just
 

2913
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:06,109
can read in my files it just
automatically splits up any big file you

2914
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:06,119
automatically splits up any big file you
 

2915
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:08,480
automatically splits up any big file you
store on it across lots of servers and

2916
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:08,490
store on it across lots of servers and
 

2917
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:12,310
store on it across lots of servers and
64 megabyte chunks so if you write

2918
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:12,320
64 megabyte chunks so if you write
 

2919
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,350
64 megabyte chunks so if you write
if you view of ten terabytes of crawled

2920
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:14,360
if you view of ten terabytes of crawled
 

2921
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:17,740
if you view of ten terabytes of crawled
web page contents and you just write

2922
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:17,750
web page contents and you just write
 

2923
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:20,110
web page contents and you just write
them to GFS even as a single big file

2924
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:20,120
them to GFS even as a single big file
 

2925
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:23,020
them to GFS even as a single big file
GFS will automatically split that vast

2926
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:23,030
GFS will automatically split that vast
 

2927
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:25,000
GFS will automatically split that vast
amount of data up into 64 kilobyte

2928
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,010
amount of data up into 64 kilobyte
 

2929
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:28,000
amount of data up into 64 kilobyte
chunks distributed evenly over all of

2930
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:28,010
chunks distributed evenly over all of
 

2931
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,940
chunks distributed evenly over all of
the GFS servers which is to say all the

2932
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:30,950
the GFS servers which is to say all the
 

2933
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:32,500
the GFS servers which is to say all the
servers that Google has available and

2934
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:32,510
servers that Google has available and
 

2935
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:34,570
servers that Google has available and
that's fantastic that's just what we

2936
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:34,580
that's fantastic that's just what we
 

2937
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,850
that's fantastic that's just what we
need if we then want to run a MapReduce

2938
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:36,860
need if we then want to run a MapReduce
 

2939
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:39,640
need if we then want to run a MapReduce
job that takes the entire crawled web as

2940
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:39,650
job that takes the entire crawled web as
 

2941
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:42,640
job that takes the entire crawled web as
input the data is already stored in a

2942
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:42,650
input the data is already stored in a
 

2943
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:44,530
input the data is already stored in a
way that split up evenly across all the

2944
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:44,540
way that split up evenly across all the
 

2945
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:47,770
way that split up evenly across all the
servers and so that means that the map

2946
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:47,780
servers and so that means that the map
 

2947
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:49,930
servers and so that means that the map
workers you know we're gonna launch you

2948
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:49,940
workers you know we're gonna launch you
 

2949
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,430
workers you know we're gonna launch you
know if we have a thousand servers we're

2950
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:51,440
know if we have a thousand servers we're
 

2951
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,990
know if we have a thousand servers we're
gonna launch a thousand map workers each

2952
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:53,000
gonna launch a thousand map workers each
 

2953
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,840
gonna launch a thousand map workers each
reading one 1000s at the input data and

2954
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:55,850
reading one 1000s at the input data and
 

2955
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:57,070
reading one 1000s at the input data and
they're going to be able to read the

2956
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:57,080
they're going to be able to read the
 

2957
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:01,450
they're going to be able to read the
data in parallel from a thousand GFS

2958
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:01,460
data in parallel from a thousand GFS
 

2959
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:04,480
data in parallel from a thousand GFS
file servers thus getting now tremendous

2960
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:04,490
file servers thus getting now tremendous
 

2961
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:07,720
file servers thus getting now tremendous
total read throughput you know the read

2962
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:07,730
total read throughput you know the read
 

2963
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:20,980
total read throughput you know the read
through put up a thousand servers

2964
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:20,990

 

2965
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:23,480

so so are you thinking maybe that Google

2966
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:23,490
so so are you thinking maybe that Google
 

2967
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:25,460
so so are you thinking maybe that Google
has one set of physical machines among

2968
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:25,470
has one set of physical machines among
 

2969
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:27,770
has one set of physical machines among
GFS and a separate set of physical

2970
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:27,780
GFS and a separate set of physical
 

2971
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:40,570
GFS and a separate set of physical
machines that run MapReduce jobs okay

2972
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:40,580

 

2973
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:44,780

right so the question is what does this

2974
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:44,790
right so the question is what does this
 

2975
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:48,620
right so the question is what does this
arrow here actually involve and the

2976
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:48,630
arrow here actually involve and the
 

2977
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:50,210
arrow here actually involve and the
answer that actually it sort of changed

2978
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:50,220
answer that actually it sort of changed
 

2979
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:51,620
answer that actually it sort of changed
over the years as Google's

2980
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:51,630
over the years as Google's
 

2981
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:55,790
over the years as Google's
involve this system but you know what

2982
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:55,800
involve this system but you know what
 

2983
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,190
involve this system but you know what
this in those general case if we have

2984
01:08:58,190 --> 01:08:58,200
this in those general case if we have
 

2985
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,070
this in those general case if we have
big files stored in some big Network

2986
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:01,080
big files stored in some big Network

streams of data often rather than this
 

3299
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,729
streams of data often rather than this
very batch approach there is a batch

3300
01:15:50,729 --> 01:15:50,739
very batch approach there is a batch
 

3301
01:15:50,739 --> 01:15:52,770
very batch approach there is a batch
approach in the sense that we wait until

3302
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:52,780
approach in the sense that we wait until
 

3303
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:54,960
approach in the sense that we wait until
we get all the data and then we process

3304
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:54,970
we get all the data and then we process
 

3305
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:57,240
we get all the data and then we process
it so first of all that you then have to

3306
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:57,250
it so first of all that you then have to
 

3307
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:59,660
it so first of all that you then have to
have a notion of finite inputs right

3308
01:15:59,660 --> 01:15:59,670
have a notion of finite inputs right
 

3309
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:02,160
have a notion of finite inputs right
modern systems often do indeed you

3310
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:02,170
modern systems often do indeed you
 

3311
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:05,970
modern systems often do indeed you
streams and and are able to take

3312
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:05,980
streams and and are able to take
 

3313
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:08,900
streams and and are able to take
advantage of some efficiencies do that

3314
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:08,910
advantage of some efficiencies do that
 

3315
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:15,450
advantage of some efficiencies do that
MapReduce okay so this is the point at

3316
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:15,460
MapReduce okay so this is the point at
 

3317
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:17,370
MapReduce okay so this is the point at
which this shuffle is where all the

3318
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:17,380
which this shuffle is where all the
 

3319
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:19,440
which this shuffle is where all the
network traffic happens this can

3320
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:19,450
network traffic happens this can
 

3321
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,030
network traffic happens this can
actually be a vast amount of data so if

3322
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:21,040
actually be a vast amount of data so if
 

3323
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,910
actually be a vast amount of data so if
you think about sort if you're sorting

3324
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:23,920
you think about sort if you're sorting
 

3325
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,700
you think about sort if you're sorting
the the output of the sort has the same

3326
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:26,710
the the output of the sort has the same
 

3327
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:29,430
the the output of the sort has the same
size as the input to the sort so that

3328
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:29,440
size as the input to the sort so that
 

3329
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,840
size as the input to the sort so that
means that if you're you know if your

3330
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:30,850
means that if you're you know if your
 

3331
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:32,880
means that if you're you know if your
input is 10 terabytes of data and you're

3332
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:32,890
input is 10 terabytes of data and you're
 

3333
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:34,740
input is 10 terabytes of data and you're
running a sort you're moving 10

3334
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:34,750
running a sort you're moving 10
 

3335
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:36,210
running a sort you're moving 10
terabytes of data across a network at

3336
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:36,220
terabytes of data across a network at
 

3337
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:38,400
terabytes of data across a network at
this point and your output will also be

3338
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:38,410
this point and your output will also be
 

3339
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:40,770
this point and your output will also be
10 terabytes and so this is quite a lot

3340
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:40,780
10 terabytes and so this is quite a lot
 

3341
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:42,420
10 terabytes and so this is quite a lot
of data and then indeed it is from any

3342
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:42,430
of data and then indeed it is from any
 

3343
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:44,130
of data and then indeed it is from any
MapReduce jobs although not all there's

3344
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:44,140
MapReduce jobs although not all there's
 

3345
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:46,440
MapReduce jobs although not all there's
some that significantly reduce the

3346
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:46,450
some that significantly reduce the
 

3347
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:49,680
some that significantly reduce the
amount of data at these stages somebody

3348
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:49,690
amount of data at these stages somebody
 

3349
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,060
amount of data at these stages somebody
mentioned Oh what if you want to feed

3350
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:51,070
mentioned Oh what if you want to feed
 

3351
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:52,890
mentioned Oh what if you want to feed
the output of reduce into another

3352
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:52,900
the output of reduce into another
 

3353
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,140
the output of reduce into another
MapReduce job and indeed that was often

3354
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:55,150
MapReduce job and indeed that was often
 

3355
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:56,969
MapReduce job and indeed that was often
what people wanted to do and

3356
01:16:56,969 --> 01:16:56,979
what people wanted to do and
 

3357
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:58,379
what people wanted to do and
in case the output of the reduce might

3358
01:16:58,379 --> 01:16:58,389
in case the output of the reduce might
 

3359
01:16:58,389 --> 01:17:00,390
in case the output of the reduce might
be enormous like four sort or web and

3360
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:00,400
be enormous like four sort or web and
 

3361
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,390
be enormous like four sort or web and
mixing the output of the produces on ten

3362
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:03,400
mixing the output of the produces on ten
 

3363
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,250
mixing the output of the produces on ten
terabytes of input the output of the

3364
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:05,260
terabytes of input the output of the
 

3365
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:07,709
terabytes of input the output of the
reduces again gonna be ten terabytes so

3366
01:17:07,709 --> 01:17:07,719
reduces again gonna be ten terabytes so
 

3367
01:17:07,719 --> 01:17:09,239
reduces again gonna be ten terabytes so
the output of the reduce is also stored

3368
01:17:09,239 --> 01:17:09,249
the output of the reduce is also stored
 

3369
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:12,629
the output of the reduce is also stored
on GFS and the system would you know

3370
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:12,639
on GFS and the system would you know
 

3371
01:17:12,639 --> 01:17:13,859
on GFS and the system would you know
reduce would just produce these key

3372
01:17:13,859 --> 01:17:13,869
reduce would just produce these key
 

3373
01:17:13,869 --> 01:17:18,359
reduce would just produce these key
value pairs but the MapReduce framework

3374
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:18,369
value pairs but the MapReduce framework
 

3375
01:17:18,369 --> 01:17:20,310
value pairs but the MapReduce framework
would gather them up and write them into

3376
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:20,320
would gather them up and write them into
 

3377
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:23,669
would gather them up and write them into
giant files on GFS and so there was

3378
01:17:23,669 --> 01:17:23,679
giant files on GFS and so there was
 

3379
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:27,479
giant files on GFS and so there was
another round of network communication

3380
01:17:27,479 --> 01:17:27,489
another round of network communication
 

3381
01:17:27,489 --> 01:17:30,209
another round of network communication
required to get the output of each

3382
01:17:30,209 --> 01:17:30,219
required to get the output of each
 

3383
01:17:30,219 --> 01:17:33,029
required to get the output of each
reduce to the GFS server that needed to

3384
01:17:33,029 --> 01:17:33,039
reduce to the GFS server that needed to
 

3385
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:35,219
reduce to the GFS server that needed to
store that reduce and because you might

3386
01:17:35,219 --> 01:17:35,229
store that reduce and because you might
 

3387
01:17:35,229 --> 01:17:37,949
store that reduce and because you might
think that they could have played the

3388
01:17:37,949 --> 01:17:37,959
think that they could have played the
 

3389
01:17:37,959 --> 01:17:39,629
think that they could have played the
same trick with the output of storing

3390
01:17:39,629 --> 01:17:39,639
same trick with the output of storing
 

3391
01:17:39,639 --> 01:17:42,479
same trick with the output of storing
the output on the GFS server that

3392
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:42,489
the output on the GFS server that
 

3393
01:17:42,489 --> 01:17:46,439
the output on the GFS server that
happened to run the MapReduce worker

3394
01:17:46,439 --> 01:17:46,449
happened to run the MapReduce worker
 

3395
01:17:46,449 --> 01:17:48,959
happened to run the MapReduce worker
that ran the reduce and maybe they did

3396
01:17:48,959 --> 01:17:48,969
that ran the reduce and maybe they did
 

3397
01:17:48,969 --> 01:17:51,750
that ran the reduce and maybe they did
do that but because GFS as well as

3398
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:51,760
do that but because GFS as well as
 

3399
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,969
do that but because GFS as well as
splitting data for performance also

3400
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:53,979
splitting data for performance also
 

3401
01:17:53,979 --> 01:17:55,919
splitting data for performance also
keeps two or three copies for fault

3402
01:17:55,919 --> 01:17:55,929
keeps two or three copies for fault
 

3403
01:17:55,929 --> 01:17:58,020
keeps two or three copies for fault
tolerance that means no matter what you

3404
01:17:58,020 --> 01:17:58,030
tolerance that means no matter what you
 

3405
01:17:58,030 --> 01:17:59,069
tolerance that means no matter what you
need to write one copy of the data

3406
01:17:59,069 --> 01:17:59,079
need to write one copy of the data
 

3407
01:17:59,079 --> 01:18:01,339
need to write one copy of the data
across a network to a different server

3408
01:18:01,339 --> 01:18:01,349
across a network to a different server
 

3409
01:18:01,349 --> 01:18:03,060
across a network to a different server
so there's a lot of network

3410
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:03,070
so there's a lot of network
 

3411
01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:05,689
so there's a lot of network
communication here and a bunch here also

3412
01:18:05,689 --> 01:18:05,699
communication here and a bunch here also
 

3413
01:18:05,699 --> 01:18:08,189
communication here and a bunch here also
and I was this network communication

3414
01:18:08,189 --> 01:18:08,199
and I was this network communication
 

3415
01:18:08,199 --> 01:18:09,989
and I was this network communication
that really limited the throughput in

3416
01:18:09,989 --> 01:18:09,999
that really limited the throughput in
 

3417
01:18:09,999 --> 01:18:10,649
that really limited the throughput in
MapReduce

3418
01:18:10,649 --> 01:18:10,659
MapReduce
 

3419
01:18:10,659 --> 01:18:17,669
MapReduce
in 2004 in 2020 because this network

3420
01:18:17,669 --> 01:18:17,679
in 2004 in 2020 because this network
 

3421
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:19,859
in 2004 in 2020 because this network
arrangement was such a limiting factor

3422
01:18:19,859 --> 01:18:19,869
arrangement was such a limiting factor
 

3423
01:18:19,869 --> 01:18:21,779
arrangement was such a limiting factor
for so many things people wanted to do

3424
01:18:21,779 --> 01:18:21,789
for so many things people wanted to do
 

3425
01:18:21,789 --> 01:18:23,910
for so many things people wanted to do
in datacenters modern data center

3426
01:18:23,910 --> 01:18:23,920
in datacenters modern data center
 

3427
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,069
in datacenters modern data center
networks are a lot faster at the root

3428
01:18:26,069 --> 01:18:26,079
networks are a lot faster at the root
 

3429
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:28,949
networks are a lot faster at the root
than this was and so you know one

3430
01:18:28,949 --> 01:18:28,959
than this was and so you know one
 

3431
01:18:28,959 --> 01:18:30,629
than this was and so you know one
typical data center network you might

3432
01:18:30,629 --> 01:18:30,639
typical data center network you might
 

3433
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:32,879
typical data center network you might
see today actually has many root instead

3434
01:18:32,879 --> 01:18:32,889
see today actually has many root instead
 

3435
01:18:32,889 --> 01:18:34,319
see today actually has many root instead
of a single root switch that everything

3436
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:34,329
of a single root switch that everything
 

3437
01:18:34,329 --> 01:18:37,620
of a single root switch that everything
has to go through you might have you

3438
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:37,630
has to go through you might have you
 

3439
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:40,259
has to go through you might have you
know many root switches and each rack

3440
01:18:40,259 --> 01:18:40,269
know many root switches and each rack
 

3441
01:18:40,269 --> 01:18:42,449
know many root switches and each rack
switch has a connection to each of these

3442
01:18:42,449 --> 01:18:42,459
switch has a connection to each of these
 

3443
01:18:42,459 --> 01:18:44,520
switch has a connection to each of these
sort of replicated root switches and the

3444
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:44,530
sort of replicated root switches and the
 

3445
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:46,469
sort of replicated root switches and the
traffic is split up among the root

3446
01:18:46,469 --> 01:18:46,479
traffic is split up among the root
 

3447
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:48,589
traffic is split up among the root
switches so modern data center networks

3448
01:18:48,589 --> 01:18:48,599
switches so modern data center networks
 

3449
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:52,259
switches so modern data center networks
have far more network throughput and

3450
01:18:52,259 --> 01:18:52,269
have far more network throughput and
 

3451
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:54,870
have far more network throughput and
because of that actually modern I think

3452
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:54,880
because of that actually modern I think
 

3453
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,089
because of that actually modern I think

Google sort of stopped using MapReduce a
few years ago but before they stopped

few years ago but before they stopped
 

3457
01:19:00,309 --> 01:19:02,580
few years ago but before they stopped
using it the modern MapReduce actually

no longer tried to run the maps on the

same machine as the data stored on they
 

3463
01:19:06,939 --> 01:19:08,129
same machine as the data stored on they
were happy to vote the data from

time for MapReduce

3470
01:19:18,429 --> 01:19:18,439
time for MapReduce
 

3471
01:19:18,439 --> 01:19:21,679
time for MapReduce
we have a lab due at the end of next

3472
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:21,689
we have a lab due at the end of next

week
in which you'll write your own somewhat

3476
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:24,840
in which you'll write your own somewhat
 

3477
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,889
in which you'll write your own somewhat
simplified MapReduce so have fun with

3478
01:19:27,889 --> 01:19:27,899
simplified MapReduce so have fun with
 

3479
01:19:27,899 --> 01:19:28,339
simplified MapReduce so have fun with
that

3480
01:19:28,339 --> 01:19:28,349
that
 

3481
01:19:28,349 --> 01:19:33,079
