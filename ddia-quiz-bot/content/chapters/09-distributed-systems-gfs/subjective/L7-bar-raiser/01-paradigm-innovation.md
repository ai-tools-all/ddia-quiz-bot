# question_title - Redefining Storage for AGI Era

## main_question - Core Question
"It's 2035. AGI systems require storage that can handle 10^18 operations/second, understand semantic meaning of data, and evolve its organization autonomously. GFS's file/chunk model is obsolete. Design a fundamentally new storage abstraction and explain how you'd migrate the world's data to it."

## core_concepts - Must Mention (60%)
### mandatory_concepts
- **Post-File Abstraction**: Beyond files to knowledge graphs or neural stores
- **Semantic Storage**: Understanding data meaning, not just bytes
- **Autonomous Evolution**: Self-organizing based on access patterns
- **Migration Strategy**: From petabytes of legacy data

### expected_keywords
- Primary keywords: semantic storage, knowledge graph, autonomous, AGI
- Technical terms: neural addressing, content-addressable, metamorphic

## peripheral_concepts - Nice to Have (40%)
### bonus_concepts
- **Consciousness Considerations**: If AGI is conscious, data rights?
- **Physics Limits**: Approaching theoretical limits of computation
- **Economic Disruption**: Impact on entire software industry
- **Philosophical Implications**: Nature of information itself
- **Biological Inspiration**: Brain-like storage architectures
- **Societal Impact**: Democracy, privacy in AGI age

### bonus_keywords
- Concepts: Holographic storage, neuromorphic, memristors
- Theory: Information theory limits, thermodynamics of computation
- Ethics: AI rights, human-AI collaboration, existential safety

## sample_excellent - Example Excellence
"For AGI-era storage, I propose **Neural Semantic Storage (NSS)**: Instead of files/blocks, data exists as interconnected concepts in a massive neural network where storage and computation are unified. Key innovations: 1) **Content-Addressed Semantics**: Data retrieved by meaning, not location. 'Find all knowledge about climate change impacts on agriculture' returns relevant data regardless of format. 2) **Metamorphic Organization**: Storage continuously reorganizes based on access patterns and learned relationships, like how the brain strengthens frequently used neural pathways. 3) **Holographic Redundancy**: Each piece contains partial information about the whole, enabling reconstruction from fragments. 4) **Temporal Versioning**: All states exist simultaneously with time as a navigable dimension. Migration strategy: Build AI translators that understand legacy formats and gradually migrate data by semantic extraction, not copying. Start with high-value knowledge bases, let AGI systems help migrate the rest. Keep GFS principle of designing for failure but apply it to semantic corruption. Revolutionary aspect: Storage becomes intelligent, not just persistent. Challenges: Massive retraining of engineers, legal frameworks for autonomous data, ensuring human comprehensibility. This isn't just evolution—it's a phase transition in how we think about information."

## sample_acceptable - Minimum Acceptable
"Move beyond files to a knowledge graph where data is stored by meaning and relationships. Use AI to understand and organize data automatically. Migration would require AI systems to read existing data and transform it into the new semantic format gradually."

## common_mistakes - Watch Out For
- Incremental improvements vs fundamental reimagining
- Ignoring migration complexity
- Hand-waving technical challenges
- Missing societal implications

## follow_up_excellent - Depth Probe
**Question**: "Your semantic storage makes decisions about data relationships. Who is liable when it makes a critical error in medical data that leads to patient harm?"
- **Looking for**: Accountability frameworks, verification systems, human oversight
- **Red flags**: Avoiding responsibility questions

## follow_up_partial - Guided Probe
**Question**: "You mentioned storage and computation unified. How does this differ from current von Neumann architecture?"
- **Hint embedded**: Memory-computation separation bottleneck
- **Concept testing**: Computer architecture understanding

## follow_up_weak - Foundation Check
**Question**: "How has human memory inspired computer storage design in the past?"
- **Simplification**: Biological analogies
- **Building block**: Bio-inspired computing

## bar_raiser_question - Beyond L7 Challenge
"Your NSS system becomes so successful that human knowledge becomes incomprehensible without it. Design safeguards to prevent humanity's cognitive dependence while maintaining progress."
