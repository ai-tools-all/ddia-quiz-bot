# question_title - Beyond GFS: Defining Next-Gen Storage

## main_question - Core Question
"You're leading storage strategy for a tech giant in 2030. Design the fundamental principles for a storage system that will handle: exascale data, quantum computing integration, edge-cloud continuum, and regulatory requirements across 100+ countries. What lessons from GFS do you keep, reject, or transform?"

## core_concepts - Must Mention (60%)
### mandatory_concepts
- **Scale Evolution**: Exascale challenges beyond GFS's petascale
- **Heterogeneous Computing**: Quantum, neuromorphic, classical integration
- **Sovereignty Requirements**: Data locality laws and compliance
- **Edge-Cloud Continuum**: Unified storage across tiers

### expected_keywords
- Primary keywords: exascale, quantum-ready, sovereignty, edge-cloud
- Technical terms: disaggregation, computational storage, zero-trust

## peripheral_concepts - Nice to Have (40%)
### bonus_concepts
- **Sustainability**: Energy efficiency as primary constraint
- **AI-Native Design**: Self-managing, self-optimizing systems
- **Economic Models**: Multi-sided marketplace for storage
- **Security Architecture**: Post-quantum cryptography
- **Biological Storage**: DNA and molecular storage integration
- **Social Responsibility**: Ethical data handling, transparency

### bonus_keywords
- Emerging tech: Photonic interconnects, superconducting storage
- Standards: Global data governance, interoperability protocols
- Business: Platform economics, data monetization ethics

## sample_excellent - Example Excellence
"For 2030 storage, I'd establish five fundamental principles transforming GFS's legacy: 1) **Computational Storage First**: Unlike GFS's separation, embed compute in storage devices for data processing at rest, reducing data movement by 90%. 2) **Quantum-Classical Hybrid**: Design quantum-resistant encryption while preparing for quantum advantage in optimization problems like placement and routing. 3) **Sovereignty-Native Architecture**: Unlike GFS's centralized master, use blockchain-inspired techniques for verifiable data locality without sacrificing performance. 4) **Energy-Proportional Design**: Replace GFS's 3x replication with adaptive erasure coding that adjusts to workload and energy costs in real-time. 5) **AI-Driven Operations**: Evolution of GFS's simplicity - system self-manages through learned models, eliminating human operators. Keep from GFS: Design for failure, commodity hardware usage. Reject: Single-region assumptions, homogeneous hardware, weak consistency as default. Transform: Master architecture becomes distributed consensus with regional autonomy. The key insight: future storage must balance global scale with local control, performance with sustainability."

## sample_acceptable - Minimum Acceptable
"Keep GFS's design for failure and commodity hardware principles. Reject the single master architecture for a globally distributed system. Add support for edge computing, stronger data sovereignty controls, and energy efficiency as a primary concern. Design for heterogeneous hardware including quantum and AI accelerators."

## common_mistakes - Watch Out For
- Incremental thinking vs transformational
- Ignoring regulatory/social aspects
- Tech-only focus without business model
- Not addressing sustainability

## follow_up_excellent - Depth Probe
**Question**: "Your design is adopted globally. How do you handle a scenario where countries have conflicting data regulations and some nations disconnect from the global internet?"
- **Looking for**: Partition tolerance, autonomous regions, conflict resolution
- **Red flags**: Assuming global cooperation

## follow_up_partial - Guided Probe
**Question**: "You mentioned quantum computing integration. What specific storage challenges does quantum computing create?"
- **Hint embedded**: State fragility, error rates, hybrid algorithms
- **Concept testing**: Emerging tech understanding

## follow_up_weak - Foundation Check
**Question**: "Let's think about how storage has evolved from filing cabinets to computers to cloud. What pattern do you see?"
- **Simplification**: Historical progression
- **Building block**: Evolution understanding

## bar_raiser_question - L7→Industry Challenge
"A nation-state actor compromises your global storage system. Design a recovery strategy that maintains service, preserves trust, and prevents recurrence."

### bar_raiser_concepts
- Zero-trust architecture evolution
- Cryptographic proof of integrity
- Gradual trust rebuilding
- International cooperation frameworks
- Technical vs political solutions
- Long-term resilience planning
