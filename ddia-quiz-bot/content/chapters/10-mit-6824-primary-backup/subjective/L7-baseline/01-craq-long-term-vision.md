# question_title - CRAQ Strategic Industry Vision

## main_question - Core Question
"Craft a five-year strategic vision for evolving CRAQ into an industry platform competing with global databases like Spanner and DynamoDB. Address technical differentiation, ecosystem strategy, and organizational alignment, drawing on DDIA's system evolution and industry impact themes." 

## core_concepts - Must Mention (60%)
### mandatory_concepts
- **Differentiation**: Emphasize CRAQ's linearizable read scaling and predictable latency vs competitors
- **Ecosystem Building**: SDKs, tooling, integration with analytics/streaming ecosystems
- **Operational Excellence**: Multi-region SLAs, self-service automation, compliance readiness
- **Organizational Strategy**: Cross-functional roadmap, community engagement, partnership model

### expected_keywords
- Primary keywords: strategic roadmap, differentiation, ecosystem, SLA, governance
- Technical terms: linearizable read scaling, global deployment, managed service, compliance

## peripheral_concepts - Nice to Have (40%)
- **Market Analysis**: Identify target industries requiring strong consistency + throughput
- **Cost Positioning**: Transparent pricing, TCO comparison
- **Innovation Thesis**: Research investments (e.g., new storage engines, hardware acceleration)
- **Risk Management**: Vendor lock-in concerns, migration tooling

### bonus_keywords
- Implementation: managed control plane, community edition, open standards, federation
- Scenarios: multi-cloud adoption, regulatory markets, fintech partnerships
- Trade-offs: pace of innovation vs stability, differentiation vs compatibility

## sample_excellent - Example Excellence
"Position CRAQ as the go-to platform for businesses needing linearizable reads at scale (finance, gaming, critical SaaS). Over five years invest in a managed service, global control plane, and integration with Kafka/Flink to differentiate from Spanner (higher latency for remote reads) and DynamoDB (eventual consistency). Build an ecosystem of SDKs, schema tools, and compliance frameworks, and shape industry standards around clean/dirty semantics. Organize teams into platform, control plane, ecosystem, and go-to-market units aligned with the roadmap, adopting DDIA's guidance on continuous evolution and operational excellence." 

## sample_acceptable - Minimum Acceptable
"Focus CRAQ on industries that need strong consistency with high read throughput, offer a managed service with global SLAs, invest in SDK/tooling integration, and align organization and partnerships around that strategy—leveraging DDIA's long-term evolution principles." 

## common_mistakes - Watch Out For
- Purely technical answer without business or ecosystem strategy
- Ignoring competitive landscape or differentiation
- No mention of organizational alignment or compliance
- Not referencing DDIA's evolution/operational themes

## follow_up_excellent - Depth Probe
**Question**: "How do you manage the tension between open ecosystem and proprietary differentiation?"
- **Looking for**: Open API standards + premium features, community governance, plug-in architecture
- **Red flags**: Either extreme without balance

## follow_up_partial - Guided Probe  
**Question**: "Which metrics indicate industry adoption success?"
- **Hint embedded**: ARR, net retention, workload share, SLA adherence
- **Concept testing**: Business literacy

## follow_up_weak - Foundation Check
**Question**: "Why do you need both a product vision and a go-to-market plan to launch a new platform?"
- **Simplification**: Vision + execution analogy
- **Building block**: Align technical and business

## bar_raiser_question - L7→L8 Challenge
"Design an industry consortium around CRAQ's clean/dirty metadata standard, including governance, certification, and compatibility programs." 

### bar_raiser_concepts
- Industry standards, consortium governance
- Certification, interoperability
- Ecosystem flywheel
- Strategic partnerships

## metadata
- **Evaluation rubric**: See GUIDELINES.md
- **Time expectation**: 6-8 min answer + 6-7 min discussion
- **Common next topics**: Market strategy, differentiation, ecosystem leadership
