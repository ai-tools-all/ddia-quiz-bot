# Task: CRAQ MCQ Generation

## Summary
- Reviewed MIT 6.824 Lecture 9 transcript to capture CRAQ highlights focused on read throughput and coordination guarantees.
- Outlined quiz coverage emphasizing CRAQ’s read-scaling goal, write acknowledgement point, and reliance on a configuration manager.
- Added three MCQ entries under `ddia-quiz-bot/content/chapters/10-mit-6824-primary-backup/mcq` for CRAQ.

## Open Questions
- Need future pass to capture CRAQ’s dirty/clean state mechanism once more transcript detail is processed.

## Follow Ups
- Run quiz validation tooling after broader CRAQ question set is expanded.
